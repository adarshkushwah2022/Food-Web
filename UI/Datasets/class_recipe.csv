Boiled potato – 2 (250 grams)
Green coriander – 2 tbsp (finely chopped)
Salt – more than ½ tsp or to taste
Coriander powder – 1 tsp
Red chili powder – ¼ tsp
Turmeric powder – ¼ tsp
Carom seeds – ¼ tsp
Oil – for frying","For making aloo masala pooris, peel the boiled potatoes and then grate them.

Take wheat flour in a big mixing bowl and to it add grated boiled potatoes, followed by salt, carom seeds, turmeric powder, red chilly powder, coriander powder and green coriander. Mix everything really well.

Mix 2 tsp oil in the flour. After this, add water in small portions and knead stiff dough (for kneading this  much quantity of flour, 1/2 cup of water is used). Cover the dough and keep aside for 15 to 20 minutes to set.

After 20 minutes, when the dough is set, knead it again until smooth. Now divide the dough into small  lumps. For making the lumps, make a long log and then divide into small lemon sized lumps (you can keep the size of lumps small or big as preferred). 

Take one lump in your hand and roll it into round dough ball. Flatten it a little into a peda. Likwise prepare rest of the dough balls as well. Meanwhile, heat enough oil in a wok for frying the pooris. Cover the dough balls to prevent them from drying. Grease the rolling plate and pin with some oil. Take one dough  ball, place it on rolling board and roll out into 3 to 4 inch diameter poori (roll the pooris from corner, so that it doesn't remain thin in the center and thick at the corner. Poori should be rolled out equally).

To check if the oil is heated well, drop a small lump into the oil. If it floats immediately on the surface then the oil is rightly hot. Now drop the poori into the wok. To puff up the poori, press it gently with the ladle. Flip the side of the poori and continue frying until golden brown.

Meanwhile fry the other poori similarly and keep checking the poori inside the wok. When the poori turns golden brown in color from both the side, transfer poori to the plate (hold the ladle over the wok so that extra oil drains back to the wok). Similarly fry rest of the pooris as well. Steaming hot aloo masala poori is ready. 

Serve these pooris piping hot with pickle, curd, chutney or any sabzi you relish eating. ",4.7gm,31.0gm,13.7gm,4.6gm,265

Put the flour and a pinch of salt into a bowl.
Add water, a little at a time to the flour to make dough.
Knead the dough for a few more minutes until its soft and pliable. Let it rest for 20 minutes.
Divide the dough into 20 pieces.

Pleat the edges of the wrapper and rotate round until it's pleated all the way around and sealed.
Oil the bottom of your steamer to stop them sticking and place into the steamer so they are not touching each other.

1 tsp salt
1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
For the tomato sauce
100ml passata
handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried
1 garlic clove, crushed
For the topping
125g ball mozzarella, sliced
handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)
handful of cherry tomatoes, halved","STEP 1
Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.

STEP 2
Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.

STEP 3
Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
