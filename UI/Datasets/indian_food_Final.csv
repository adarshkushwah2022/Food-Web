Balu shahi,"Maida flour, yogurt, oil, sugar",vegetarian,45,25,sweet,dessert,West Bengal,East,"   Creaming Ghee
Take ¼ cup ghee in a bowl.
With a spoon or spatula or a small wired whisk, beat the ghee till it is smooth, light and fluffy. Its color will also lighten.
Add ¼ cup chilled fresh curd (dahi).
Again with a spoon or spatula or a small wired whisk, mix and whip the curd with the creamed ghee.
Cream till light and smooth.
   Making Badusha Dough
Now using a sieve, take 2 cups maida (all purpose flour) in it. Place it on the bowl itself. You can also sift the flour separately in a plate or tray.
Add 1 pinch salt, 1 pinch baking soda and ½ teaspoon baking powder.
Sift directly in the creamed ghee and curd.
Mix the flour lightly with the creamed ghee and curd using a spoon or spatula.
Sprinkle some cold water in parts and begin to mix it. Overall you can use 8 to 9 tablespoons cold water. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons water at a time and mix.
Mix and combine everything to form a soft dough. Do not knead. Just mix and bring everything together to a dough. In case the dough becomes sticky, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons flour. Cover the dough and keep aside for 15 minutes. Use light pressure from hands and form a dough. Do not knead heavily or if required then knead very lightly.
    Making Sugar Syrup
Meanwhile make sugar syrup. While frying balushahi also you can make sugar syrup. Take 200 grams sugar or 1 heaped cup of sugar in a pan or bowl. Use a bowl or pan with more surface area so that the balushahi can get enough space for soaking.
Add ½ cup water and mix.
Place the pan on a low flame.
Using a spoon stir the sugar so that it dissolves. If there are impurities in the sugar syrup, then add 1 tablespoon milk. Remove the scum that forms at the top.
When all the sugar has dissolved, add ½ to 1 teaspoon cardamom powder. Then add 10 to 12 saffron strands. Stir again.
Simmer the sugar solution on a low to medium-low flame. Do stir occasionally. To avoid crystallisation of sugar, you can add some drops of lemon juice.
Simmer till the syrup becomes sticky or you get ½ string consistency in the syrup. You can even cook it to 1 string consistency.
The sugar syrup should be sticky. So cool syrup in a spoon and touch it and it should feels sticky. When the syrup becomes sticky, then switch off flame.
   Frying Balushahi
Before frying balushahi you can begin to heat oil in a kadai or pan on a medium flame. Do use a kadai with handles at the sides. You can also use ghee instead of oil to fry balushahi.
Pinch small to medium-sized balls from the dough. Roll them gently and lightly between your palms.
Then make an indent or depression in them. You can flatten them slightly if you want. Cover the remaining dough and keep aside. Make 5 to 6 badhusha depending on the size of kadai.
Check a tiny piece of the badhusha dough in the medium hot oil. It should come up gradually and steadily.
Now lift the kadai from stove top and keep it on the kitchen table top. Gently begin to place balushahi in the hot oil.
Be careful when you are keeping the balushahi in hot oil. Add 5 to 6 or 7 balushahi depending on the size of kadai. It will expand in oil while frying, so make sure not to over crowd the kadai or pan.
Now lift the kadai and place it again on a low flame.
Begin to fry badusha on a low flame.
When one side firms up and is light golden, turn over each badusha.
Keep on turning them over at intervals and frying them on a low flame.
Frying balushahi on a low flame takes about 12 to 15 minutes. This will depend on the size, thickness of kadai and the intensity of flame. It took me 14 minutes to fry each batch of 6 balushahi.
Fry till golden and crisp.
Using a slotted spoon remove them draining the extra oil.
Place them on kitchen paper towels. When the first batch is getting fried, you can make balushahi from the dough and keep them ready to fry in the second round. Keep them covered with a kitchen napkin. Then fry the second batch of balushahi in the same way, we fried the first batch.
Making Balushahi
After a couple of minutes, when fried balushahi are still hot, place them in the hot or warm sugar syrup.
With spoon or tongs turn over each badusha, so that both sides are coated with sugar syrup. Let these badusha soak in the sugar syrup for about 14 to 15 minutes.
After 14 to 15 minutes, using tongs or spoon, lift each balushahi and place it in a serving tray or bowl. In the same sugar syrup, now add the second batch of balushahi.
Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons of pistachios all over. You can even sprinkle some saffron strand, rose petals and cardamom powder if you want. Press the pistachios, so that they stick to the sugar syrup on the badusha.
Fry the remaining badusha and then soak them in the sugar syrup. In case if sugar syrup crystallises then add 2 to 3 tablespoons water and warm or heat the syrup again on a low flame.
Serve balushahi as a sweet. Leftovers can be easily stored in an air-tight jar or container at room temperature for about 5 to 6 days."
Boondi,"Gram flour, ghee, sugar",vegetarian,80,30,sweet,dessert,Rajasthan,West,"Sift besan into a large bowl. Add pinch of baking soda and 1/2 cup + 3 tablespoons water and mix to form a free flowing batter.
Let the batter rest for 15 minutes and then remaining 1 tablespoon water and mix. The batter is now ready.
Heat oil or ghee in a kadai/wok on medium-high heat. I used a mix of oil and ghee to fry boondi.
Place the ladle 3 to 4 inches above the surface of oil (not very high else boondi will have tail). Once oil is hot, pour batter into the ladle, do not spread by spoon. Let it fall on its own.
Move the ladle around the kadai as the batter falls, so that boondis don't clump together and spread well.
Fry for 30 to 40 seconds, do not over cook. Remove the boondi immediately from hot oil.
For the next batch, wash your ladle and wipe it dry. Then repeat the same process. If you don't wipe the ladle after each batch, boondi won't be round.
Fry in batches until the batter is over. Keep all the fried boondi on a plate.
To make the sugar syrup, heat 1 cup sugar (200 grams) with 3/4 cup water (6 oz/180 ml) on medium heat.
Add food color if using (optional).
Let the sugar dissolve. Then let it boil for 3 minutes (not cooking for any string consistency here). Add the cardamom powder and also add whole cloves.
Turn off the heat and add the fried boondi. Mix well.
Cover the pan and let the boondi sit in the pan until it soaks all the sugar syrup (chasni). Stir the boondi every 1 hour or so. Let sit overnight.
Sweet boondi is ready to serve!"
Gajar ka halwa,"Carrots, milk, sugar, ghee, cashews, raisins",vegetarian,15,60,sweet,dessert,Punjab,North,"   Preparation
First rinse, peel and then grate the carrots (8-9 medium sized tender juicy carrots), either with a hand held grater or in a food processor.
You need approx 4 to 4.5 cups grated carrots.
   Making Carrot Halwa
In a kadai or deep thick bottomed pan combine milk and grated carrots.
On a low to medium flame, bring the whole mixture to a boil and then simmer.
While the mixture is simmering on a low flame, keep on stirring in between.
The grated carrots will cook in the milk and the milk will start to reduce and evaporate.
When the milk has 75% reduced, add the ghee, sugar and powdered cardamom to the mixture.
Stir well and continue to simmer and cook on a low flame.
Do keep on stirring the halwa in between.
Towards the end, add the cashews, almonds, saffron and raisins. Simmer the halwa till all the milk is evaporated. Switch off the burner.
Serve gajar halwa hot, warm or you can also serve it cold. garnish with some chopped dry fruits while serving.  "

now add 2 cup maida and crumble well.
further, add ½ cup chilled milk and give a rough mix.
additionally, add 3 cup of chilled water, 1 tsp lemon juice and make a smooth flowing consistency
pour the 2 tbsp of batter keeping a good distance from hot oil.
the batter will splatter and later the froth subsides. repeat 10-15 times
pull the ghevar out once cooked, and drain off the oil completely.
pour the sugar syrup over ghevar, garnish with chopped nuts and sprinkle cardamom powder.
finally, garnish the ghevar with silver vrak or rabri and ready to serve."
Gulab jamun,"Milk powder, plain flour, baking powder, ghee, milk, sugar, water, rose water",vegetarian,15,40,sweet,dessert,West Bengal,East,"   Making Dough
Take khoya (mawa or evaporated milk) in a bowl. Mash it very well. There should be no lumps. You can also grate and then mash the khoya.
Then add grated paneer, rava (sooji), all purpose flour (maida), baking powder and cardamom powder to the mashed khoya. There should be no lumps in both the mawa and paneer.
As if they are there, then you will find the texture of the gulab jamun not so good. The bits and pieces of mava or paneer will give a bite in the mouth, when you have the gulab jamun. They won’t be smooth.
Mix well. Add milk and gather together to form a dough with milk. Don’t knead.
Just gently mix. If you are unable to form balls or if the mixture appears dry, then add a few teaspoons of milk. Cover the dough and keep aside for 30 mins.
Make small balls from the dough. Cover the balls and keep aside.
   Making Sugar Syrup
Dissolve sugar in water. Heat the sugar solution till it become sticky. You just need to switch off the fire before the syrup reaches a one thread consistency.
Add rose water and stir. Keep the sugar solution aside. On cooling if the sugar syrup crystallizes, then just add 2 to 3 tbsp water and warm the syrup again. It will again return to a liquid state.
   Frying
Meanwhile, while the sugar syrup is cooking, heat oil till its medium hot. Lower the flame and wait for a minute. Then gently place the dough balls in the oil.
Once they start to have tiny golden spots, keep on rotating them in the oil, so that the jamun are evenly browned.
Remove the fried jamun and then drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil.
   Making Gulab Jamun
Then place the hot fried dough balls in the sugar syrup. Continue frying the rest of the dough balls in batches.
When all the jamuns are placed in the sugar syrup, then keep the whole pan with the sugar syrup and the gulab jamun, on a low flame for 1 to 2 minutes till the jamun become soft.
Heating helps the gulab jamun to absorb the syrup and become soft. The jamun increase a bit in size. Don’t overcook as then the jamun can break.
Use a large pan, so that the jamuns are not overcrowded and you can easily stir them gently while they are simmering.
Serve gulab jamun warm or at room temperature. You can also chill them and serve them cold. Garnish with rose petals or almond slivers."
Imarti,"Sugar syrup, lentil flour",vegetarian,10,50,sweet,dessert,West Bengal,East,"Soak dhuli urad dal overnight or for a minimum of 6 hours in enough water.
Transfer the soaked dal to your blender and adding little water at a time, blend the dal to a fine paste.
Transfer to a bowl and add food color and rice flour to it.
Using your hands or a spoon, mix the batter for 3-4 minutes continuously. Set aside for 15-20 minutes.
While the batter is resting for 15 minutes, make the sugar syrup.
Add sugar in a pan on medium heat and add water just enough to cover the sugar. Stir continuously till sugar is dissolved.
After 4-5 minutes the syrup will develop a one string consistency which means that if you put a drop of the syrup between your thumb and index finger and move the fingers apart, you will notice the syrup forming one string/thread (see picture above for reference).
At this stage add rose water, crushed cardamom seeds, saffron strands, lemon juice and switch off the heat. The sugar syrup is now ready for dipping in the imartis.
Pour ghee into a kadai on medium-low heat.
While the ghee is getting hot, transfer the batter into the piping bag or a squeeze bottle. I used wilton tip#10 here, you can simply use a ziplock bag and make a small cut in it to pipe the imartis.
Pipe the imartis into the ghee once it's mildly hot. Make sure ghee is not super hot else you won't be able to pipe the batter, keep the heat at medium-low.
Make one round with the batter and then start making small circles adjacent to one another on top of that round that you first made. [See pictures of how the front and back of imarti should look like in the post above].
Once you have piped the batter, increase heat to medium and fry till crisp from both sides.
Once fried, take out the imarti, shaking off the excess ghee.
Dip the fried imarti in the sugar syrup for few seconds. Remember the sugar syrup should be warm at this point.
Flip the imarti to dip the other side in the sugar syrup too.
Remove from the sugar syrup and transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or silicone mat.
Garnish with crushed pistachios immediately."
Jalebi,"Maida, corn flour, baking soda, vinegar, curd, water, turmeric, saffron, cardamom",vegetarian,10,50,sweet,dessert,Uttar Pradesh,North,"   Making Batter
In a mixing bowl, take the 1 cup of all purpose flour or maida. Add besan or gram flour, a pinch of baking soda and turmeric powder.
Mix all the above dry ingredients with a spoon or spatula.
Then add water. The amount of water to be added depends on the quality of flour used. I added 1 cup water. Depending on the quality of flour and besan, you can add from ¾ to 1 cup water.
With the spatula or spoon, first mix. Break the small or tiny lumps with the spatula or spoon while mixing.
Then in round circular directions stir the batter briskly for 4 minutes. This adds volume to the batter and makes it even and smooth.
The batter should have a flowing consistency. Cover and keep the batter to ferment in a warm place for 12 to 15 hours. I kept for 15 hours. If you live in a cold climate, you can keep for 20 to 24 hours and if you live in a hot or warm climate, keep for 6 to 10 hours.
After fermentation the batter will have tiny air-pockets in it with a tangy taste.
Stir the batter and if you carefully see, the batter would have become thinner than what it was before fermentation.
So to thicken the batter again, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour.
With a spoon mix very well.
Now pour this batter in the squeezy tomato ketchup bottles that we get in the market. You can also use coconut shell and make a small hole in it. You can also use a piping bag or make your own with butter paper. Depending on the capacity of the bottle, you can pour less or more in it.
   Preparing Sugar Syrup
Take 1 cup sugar in a pan. Add saffron strands to it. Do add saffron as it gives a nice orange yellow color and also its aroma to the jalebi.
Add ½ cup of water.
Keep this pan on stove top on low heat and begin to stir, so that the sugar dissolves.
On a low to medium flame, cook the sugar syrup.
Cook till you get one string consistency in the sugar syrup.
Once you get the one string consistency, switch off the heat and add ¼ tsp lime or lemon juice. Stir well. Keep the sugar syrup on the burner itself so that it remains warm when you add the jalebi in it.
   Frying Jalebi
Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. You can also use ghee or half-half of oil and ghee. Ghee gives a better flavor.
To check the temperature of oil, add a tiny amount of batter to the oil. If it comes up quickly and gradually the oil is hot enough for the jalebi to be fried. The frying temperature is 350 degrees Fahrenheit/176 degrees Celsius.
Now squeeze the bottle and make concentric rings with the batter.
Either start from the center and move outside or vice versa. Be careful while making the jalebis as the oil is hot.
You won't get perfect shapes as the jalebis keep on moving while you make the circles. This does require practice and it also depends on what equipment you are using to make them.
When one side is partly cooked, turn over and fry the other side.
Some jalebi will be cooked faster than others.
Fry till the oil stops sizzling and the jalebis are a light golden. Remove with a tongs or a bamboo skewer. While removing shake to drain the extra oil.
Adding Fried Jalebi To Sugar Syrup
Then immediately put the fried jalebis in the sugar syrup. The sugar syrup should be slightly hot or warm when you add the jalebis in it.
Turn over after after a minute so that both sides are coated with the syrup.
Keep them in the syrup for about 2 to 3 minutes. If you keep for two minutes, they will be lightly colored and if you keep for 3 minutes or more, they will have a deep color.
Remove with a wooden skewer or tongs. Shake lightly so that the excess sugar syrup falls back in the pan. Place them in a plate or tray lined with a foil or butter paper.
Make all jalebi this way. Its better to have a help while doing so. Otherwise it is kind of multi-tasking.
Serve jalebi hot, warm or at room temperature. The leftovers can be kept in an airtight container and refrigerated."
Kaju katli,"Cashews, ghee, cardamom, sugar",vegetarian,10,20,sweet,dessert,-1,-1,"   Grinding Cashews
Powder the cashew in a coffee grinder, blender or a dry grinder.
The cashews should be in powdered form and not become pasty or oily.
   Making Dough
On a low flame heat sugar and water in a thick bottomed or non stick pan or kadai.
Meanwhile grease a plate or a tray and keep aside or keep butter papers ready.
When all the sugar has dissolved in the water, add the cashew powder. There is no consistency in the sugar syrup required like one string or two string. Just let the sugar dissolve in the water and then proceed with the next step.
Mix and keep on stirring the cashew mixture non-stop on a low flame.
The cashew mixture would start thickening.
Cook the kaju mixture for approx 7 to 9 minutes until the whole dough starts to come together.
   Making Kaju Katli
Remove the whole lump of the kaju dough from the pan and place it on your work surface or in a bowl or plate.
Add the rose petals and ghee or oil to the cashew mixture.
When the heat in the dough is hot enough to handle, then knead the cashew mixture lightly.
Flatten the dough and place it on a butter paper or on a greased plate or tray.
Place a butter paper on top and then using a rolling pin, roll gently the dough from all sides till you reach a thickness of 3 to 5 mm in the dough.
Remove the butter paper and let the rolled dough cool.
When completely cooled, using a sharp knife cut the cashew dough giving square or diamond shapes.
Gently remove the kaju barfi with a butter knife.
Serve the kaju katli straight away or keep in an airtight container."
Kalakand,"Milk, cottage cheese, sugar",vegetarian,20,30,sweet,dessert,West Bengal,East,"  Preparation
Grease a pan or a tray with some ghee or oil.
Crush coarsely pistachios, saffron and cashews or almonds in a mortar-pestle. You can also sliver or slice the nuts.
Grate 250 to 300 grams paneer. You can also crumble the paneer. If the paneer is refrigerated, then I suggest to grate it. If freshly made, then you can crumble it finely. There should be no chunks in the crumble.
   Making Kalakand Sweet
Take 1 tin/can (400 grams) of sweetened condensed milk in a thick bottomed pan or kadai.
Add the grated or crumbled paneer to the condensed milk. Mix very well.
I did add some sugar as I felt the sweet taste was less for us. I added 1 tablespoons sugar. You can check the taste and add accordingly.
Keep the heat on low or sim and cook this mixture of condensed milk and grated paneer.
Stir the mixture often so that it does not stick to the bottom of the pan.
The kalakand mixture will start thickening as it simmers and begins to cook.
When the mixture gets thickened well, looks like one mass and starts leaving the sides of the pan then switch off the heat.
Keep in mind that the kalakand mixture should have some moisture and should not look dry. It should not have a liquid consistency or be runny.
It took me 15 minutes on a low heat. Depending on the quality of your pan, pan thickness and size, flame intensity it may take 12 to 16 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat. Add cardamom powder and rose water. Stir very well.
   Setting Kalakand
Now pour the kalakand mixture in the prepared greases pan or tray.
Shake the pan gently so that the mixture spreads evenly. You can also level with a spoon or spatula.
Sprinkle coarsely crushed nuts or slivered nuts all over the kalakand.
Gently press the nuts with a spoon. Cover and allow the kalakand to become warm or cool completely at room temperature. Then keep in the fridge for a couple of hours for it to set.
After it sets, slice the kalakand and serve. In case if you cannot slice the kalakand, then don’t worry. You can just serve it with a spoon like a halwa. It still tastes delicious.
Serve kalakand as a sweet or as a dessert. Keep any leftovers in the fridge in an air-tight container. Kalakand keeps well for 2 to 3 days in the fridge."
Kheer,"Milk, rice, sugar, dried fruits",vegetarian,10,40,sweet,dessert,-1,-1,"   Preparation
Rinse ¼ cup basmati rice a couple of times till the water runs clear of the starch.
Then soak the rice in enough water for 15 to 20 mins.
Blanching almonds – heat water in a small pan or pot. When the water comes to a boil then switch off the flame and then add 10 to 12 almonds to it. Cover and keep aside for 30 minutes. Then peel and slice almonds. This is an optional step. 
   Cooking Rice
Meanwhile, when the rice grains are soaking, take whole or full fat milk in a heavy wide pan or saucepan or kadai.
Keep the pan on a low to medium-low heat. Stir at intervals so that the milk does not stick at the bottom of the pan.
Let the milk come to a boil.
Take 1 tablespoon milk from the pan in a small bowl. Let the milk become warm. Then add a few saffron strands in the milk. Keep aside.
After the milk begins to boil, drain all the water from the rice and add it to the hot boiling milk. mix very well.
Simmer and cook rice on a low heat. No need to cover the pan when the rice is cooking.
Cook the rice grains till they are 50% done or half-cooked.
Then add sugar. You can add more or less sugar according to your preferences. Mix the sugar in the milk with a spoon.
Continue to cook rice on a low to medium-low heat. Do stir at intervals. Simmer till the rice is almost cooked.
   Flavoring The Rice Kheer
Then add ½ teaspoon cardamom powder. Add blanched and peeled sliced almonds and chopped cashews and sliced pistachios. Mix well.
Then add the saffron infused milk.
Again mix and continue to cook on a low flame till the rice kheer thickens and the rice grains have completely cooked.
Switch off the heat when the rice grains are completely cooked. The kheer will also thicken. On cooling rice kheer thickens more. Scrape milk solids from sides and add to kheer.
Lastly add 1 tablespoon golden raisins. At this step you can add 1 tablespoons rose water or kewra water to the kheer.
Pour the kheer in individual serving bowls. You can serve the rice kheer, hot or warm or chilled. Refrigerate leftover rice kheer in a closed container and eat it in 1 to 2 says.
You can enjoy it cold or warm it before serving. If the kheer has become very thick then add a splash of milk and reheat it until warm."
Laddu,"Gram flour, ghee, sugar",vegetarian,10,40,sweet,dessert,-1,-1,"   Roasting Besan
Dry roast the besan in a heavy kadai or pan on low to medium-low heat for about 10 to 12 minutes.
Keep on stirring continuously right from the beginning. So that the besan is not burned and cooks evenly.
   Adding Ghee And Roasting Further
After 12 minutes of total roasting time, add the ghee.
Mix very well and continue roasting the besan for some more 12 to 15 minutes stirring non-stop.
You will see that the mixture will start releasing ghee and will give a nice fragrant nutty aroma. Some ghee will float on top and and you will see a molten lava kind of consistency where the ghee is floating. The mixture will also loose sides of the pan and become one. These are the signs that the besan is fully cooked. Once you see these signs, you can move on to the next step.
Remove the pan from the stove-top and place it on your kitchen countertop. Add powdered sugar.
   Adding Powdered Sugar
Begin to mix with all the strength from your hands. You have to mix this part vigorously so that the powdered sugar melts in the roasted besan and ghee mixture and no lumps are formed.
Add the powdered cardamom, raisins and cashews. Mix again.
Once you have mixed the ladoo mixture well then let it become lukewarm or cool at room temperature.
   Making Besan Ladoo
When cooled, make small or medium-sized besan ladoo and store them in an airtight steel container. If you are not able to shape in balls then freeze the mixture for 5 minutes or refrigerate for 20 minutes. Depending on the quality and consistency of ghee as well as the room temperature you may be able to easily shape these or not.
Serve besan ladoo garnished with some nuts."

   Cooking Milk To Half Of Its Volume
Take whole milk in a thick bottomed kadai or pan and begun to heat the milk on a low to medium heat, till the milk starts to froth or form a layer of clotted cream (malai) on top. Stir a couple of time when the milk is getting heated.
So when you will see the cream floating on top, then with a spatula, gently move the cream layer.
Bring it towards the side of the pan and stick it to the pan. Keep the heat to a low and continue to simmer.
Keep on simmering the milk like this and collecting the cream layer on the sides.
This process of collecting the cream layer has to be done many times. continuous simmering of the milk will bring the cream on top and you have to bring and stick it to the sides of the pan.
In between also stir the milk gently on occasions, so that the milk does not get burnt from the bottom. If you do too much of stirring and if quickly, then you won't get the layers of cream in the rabri. 
So after you have moved the layer of cream (malai) to the side of the pan, then stir the milk a few times. Then wait until another layer of cream forms on the surface of the milk.
You can also just thicken and scrape the milk solids from the sides but in this case you won't get the layers of clotted cream or malai in the rabdi.
   Making Rabdi Recipe
Once the milk reduces to half, then add sugar. You can add sugar as per your taste preferences.
Then add crushed saffron strands and cardamom powder. Stir gently.
Continue collecting the cream and bringing it to the sides of the pan. Also do stir the milk gently after you bring the cream towards the sides of the pan. If you don’t stir the milk then there is a possibility of the milk getting browned or burnt from the bottom.
After adding saffron, the color will change gradually to a beautiful yellow color as the milk keeps on reducing.
When the milk gets reduced to ⅓ or ¼ of its original quantity, then switch off the heat. It took me about 1 hour 15 minutes on a low heat initially and medium heat towards the latter stage. I cooked it until ⅓ of its original volume.
The cream layer will be collected on the sides with a spatula. Scrape off the entire cream layer as well as dried milk solids and add into the thickened milk.
Stir gently. Then add the sliced almonds, pistachios and 1 teaspoon rose water or kewra water. Stir gently again. Reserve a few of the blanched and slivered nuts for garnish."

Chhena Poda,"Sugar, chenna cheese",vegetarian,10,45,sweet,dessert,Odisha,East,"  Preparation
Firstly line a baking pan with some chopped banana leaves. Grease the banana leaves with some ghee. 
You can also use butter paper or parchment paper instead of banana leaves. Or you can skip everything and just grease the pan with ghee on all sides. 
Also preheat oven at 180 degrees celsius for 15 minutes.
   Making Chhena Poda Mixture
Then take the 250 grams fresh paneer or chenna and crumble it very well.
Then add ½ cup sugar. You can also use ½ cup jaggery powder instead of sugar.
With clean hands mix sugar with the chenna.
Then continue to mash and knead the paneer or chenna like the way you would knead a chapati dough.
The paneer mixture has to become loose, light and with a cake batter like consistency. The more light and softer the consistency, the better the chhena poda tastes.
I have not added any milk or water. In case the mixture looks dry, then you can add a few tablespoons of milk or water. Some amount of fat is released while mashing chenna and thats fine.
Once you get a cake batter like consistency in the paneer mixture, then add ½ teaspoon cardamom powder and ½ tablespoon rice flour. Optionally a pinch of baking soda can also be added, but does not make any difference. Instead of rice flour, you can also use fine rava (sooji). Some chopped dry fruits like cashews, almonds and raisins can also be added.
   Baking Chhena Poda
Pour the chhena poda mixture in the pan. Shake the pan gently so that the chenna poda mixture spreads evenly. Level the top with a spatula.
Place the pan in the oven and bake chena poda for 30 to 45 minutes. If using otg, use the toast mode and keep pan in the center. Bake chena poda till the top crust gets a dark golden color. Oven times vary, so do keep a check. In some ovens this paneer cake can even take less time. I am giving an average time that will work for most ovens.
Remove from the oven once done.
Then check with a bamboo skewer or toothpick and it should be clean. There should be no sticky batter on the toothpick.
Let the paneer cake cool completely in the pan. Then remove it.
You can slice and then serve chenna poda. Leftover can be refrigerated for 2 to 3 days.
Serve chhena poda as dessert after meals or as a sweet snack."
Cham cham,"Flour, cream, sugar, saffron, lemon juice, coconut flakes",vegetarian,40,60,sweet,dessert,West Bengal,East,"Making Chenna
Begin to heat 1 litre milk in a thick bottomed pan. Stir at intervals when the milk begins to get heated.
When the milk comes to a boil, you will see a layer of malai or clotted cream which forms on top. Remove this layer of malai. You will get about 2 to 3 tablespoons of malai. We will be using this malai to make the sweet filling for cham cham.
Switch off flame when milk comes to rolling boil.
Add 2 tablespoons vinegar or lemon juice. You can even add 1 tablespoon vinegar or lemon juice. The amount to be added will depend on the quality of milk.
Mix very well and let milk curdle.
Wait for 4 to 5 mins and let the heat reduce a bit. Then strain through muslin lined on a top of a bowl or pan.
Bring the edges of the muslin together, straining all the whey. Be careful as both the chenna and whey will be hot.
Rinse the chenna very well in running water. This removes the lemony flavor and tangy taste from the chenna. Then gently queeze the muslin with your hands, so that any extra water is drained from the chenna. 
Keep a heavy weighted bowl or mortar-pestle on the chenna for 8 to 10 minutes.
Kneading Chenna
After 8 to 10 minutes remove the chenna from the muslin. Place on a tray or a plate. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon maida or all purpose flour. You can even add 1 teaspoon rava (sooji) or corn flour instead of maida.
Mix and begin to knead this mixture. Knead very well till some greasiness is felt in your palms. Just a bit of greasiness is required. Knead to a smooth ball of chenna. If mixture looks dry and crumby sprinkle some water – about 1 to 3 teaspoons or more and continue to knead. The mixture should be able to come together without breaking or falling apart. For a dry chenna a bit of moisture helps in binding the mixture.
Then roll the chenna ball into a log. cut in equal pieces.
Take each piece and roll them between your palms to a smooth cylindrical or oblong shape. pinch the edges.
Make oblong shaped cham cham with the entire kneaded chenna. keep them covered with a moist muslin cloth.
Making Sugar Syrup For Chum Chum
Take 2 heaped cups sugar (400 grams) in a large pan. Please use a large pot or pan so that there is enough space for the cham cham to cook and increase in size.
Pour 4 cups water (1 litre) in the pan.
Place the pan on a medium-low to medium flame. With a spoon stir non-stop and mix so that all the sugar is dissolved.
When all the sugar is dissolved, remove 1 cup of sugar solution and keep it aside. let the sugar solution come to a boil on a medium-high flame.
Cooking Chom Chom
When the sugar solution starts boiling, carefully place the chum chum in the sugar solution. Gently shake the pan holding the handles at the sides.
Cover the pan with lid and boil chum chum on medium-high flame for 5 minutes.
After 5 minutes in a gentle stream, slowly add the 1 cup of reserved sugar solution. hold the pan at the handles and gently shake it.
Cover again with lid and cook covered for 7 minutes. I cooked for a total of 12 minutes. The cooking time will vary with the intensity of flame, pan type and size etc.
To check if the cham cham has cooked, take one piece and place it in a bowl or mug of water. It should settle down at the bottom. If it floats then the cham cham needs to be cooked for a few more minutes.
Once the chum chum are cooked, switch off flame. Keep the pan down and remove the lid.
After five minutes add 1 tablespoon kewra water or rose water. You can also add ½ to 1 teaspoon cardamom powder. Shake the pan gently. Let cham cham cool completely.
Making Stuffing For Chum Chum
In a heavy kadai or pan, take 6 tablespoons milk powder, 2 tablespoons sugar, 7 to 8 strands saffron and ¼ teaspoon cardamom powder.
Next add 2 tablespoons malai or cream reserved from the milk when we had boiled it. Also add 2 to 3 tablespoons milk.
Mix everything and keep pan or kadai on a low flame.
Stirring often begin to cook this mixture.
The mixture will begin to thicken. Stir continuously and cook till the mixture leaves sides of pan. Let this mixture cool completely.
Making Chum Chum
Place them on a tray and board. With a knife make cut each cham cham on top. Do not cut the cham cham entirely.
Place the stuffing in the cham cham sweet carefully without breaking them.
Stuff all the pieces this way.
Take desiccated coconut in a plate and gently roll cham cham sweet so that the desiccated coconut sticks to the cham cham.
Do this with all the cham cham pieces.
Place them on a serving plate or tray. Garnish with sliced pistachios and almonds.

Cover the bowl and allow the batter to rest for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile when the batter is resting blanch the almonds and pistachios in hot water. Keep them soaked in hot water for 20 to 30 minutes. Then peel and slice them. Keep aside.
Making Sugar Syrup
In a pan take sugar and water. Stir so that the sugar dissolves. On a low heat simmer this mixture.
You need to have a ½ string or 1 string consistency in the sugar syrup. If you cannot achieve these string consistencies than just make a sticky syrup.
The sugar needs to be kept warm. For this keep the sugar syrup on a hot water bath so that it stays warm throughout and does not crystallize. Meaning you have to keep the sugar syrup pan on a bowl or another pan filled with hot water. The hot water should touch the base of the pan containing the sugar syrup.
Making Malpua
Heat ghee in a frying pan or skillet.
When the ghee is heating up add baking soda to the batter.
Stir to combine so that the baking soda is mixed evenly with the batter.
Lower the heat. Take 2 to 3 tablespoons or a ladle of the batter and gently pour it on the hot ghee. Spread the batter lightly with the back of the spoon. Make 2 to 4 malpua depending on the size of the frying pan.
Fry on a low to medium heat. When one side is light golden and crisp, gently turnover and fry the second side until crisp and light golden.
Fry until both sides are golden flipping the malpua as needed for a couple of times.

Mix very well till all the jaggery is dissolved.
Add ½ teaspoon cardamom powder. Mix well and let the milk become warm.
Check the temperature of milk. It should be warm – meaning if you dip your finger in the milk, your finger should feel comfortably warm but not hot. If you have a cooking thermometer, you can check the temperature. It should be between 40 to 44 degrees celsius.
Now add 2 tablespoons curd.
With a whisk mix very well. The curd should dissolve in the milk. If you want you can even beat the curd before you add.
Setting Mishti Doi
Now pour the doi mixture in earthen or terracotta bowls or earthen handi.
Cover with a lid or seal with aluminium foil.
Keep in a warm place for the mishti doi to set. Mishti doi takes longer to set than curd. the timing will also vary with the temperature in your city. So you can keep for 9 to 24 hours.

Make Puli like this from the dough . Around 8-10 puli you should get from one cup of flour.
Once done, cover the filled puli with a damp cloth. Inspect closely for any gaps. Filling should be well sealed from all sides.
Now heat enough water in a steamer. Once the water is on rolling boil, grease the steamer plate with little oil. Place the rice dumplings or puli on it. Do not over crowd it. Depending upon the size of steamer, you can steam minimum 4-5 puli in one go.
Steam the rice dumplings or puli for 8-10 minutes. The puli will slightly change the color once it get evenly steamed.
Serve warm immediately. Leftovers can be refrigerated. Before serving, steam it again ."
Rasabali,"Chenna, sweetened milk",vegetarian,15,30,sweet,dessert,Odisha,East,"For making chenna dumplings
For making 250gm chenna - boil around 1/1 2 l milk and add vinegar. Once the milk is curdled, strain the whey, collect the chenna or cheese in a cheese cloth, wash it under running water. Tied the cloth tightly and let the chenna hung for one hour.
To the freshly made chenna, add all the ingredients listed under For chenna dumplings, except ghee / oil.
Knead the chenna with the heel of your palm and mash it with your knuckles. This step is very well explained in my Mango sandesh recipe post. Link is given in the post. Please refer it.
Once it is done, you will notice that your palm is greasy. Do not knead further. Chenna is ready.
Divide the chenna into equal portions, make small balls out of it. Flatten it into round disc shape. If possible, make a small hole at the center with your index finger.
Keep aside.
Heat a kadhai or deep fry pan. Add enough oil / ghee into it and heat it. I always use ghee and refined oil mix. Also I do not add all the oil or ghee at once. I keep on adding it as requires. This way, you wont be left with too much fried oil / ghee.
Fry the chenna dumplings one by one (or max two, but do not crowded it) on low heat till reddish brown on all sides.
Take care not to over fry this. Else it will spoil the texture of rasabali and will become hard and chewy.
Drain the rasabali on kitchen towel.
Reduced milk
Boil the milk till it is reduced to half its original volume.
Reducing the milk takes long time around 30-40 min. So before making the chenna dumplings, start reducing the milk first. While this is going on, you can begin with chenna dumplings.
This will save time.
Add sugar, crushed cardamoms and saffron.
Once the milk is reduced sufficiently, check for the sweetness.
Now add the fried rasabali into the hot milk and simmered in the milk on low heat for 3-4 minutes.a

Mysore pak,"Besan flour, semolina, mung bean, jaggery, coconut, skimmed milk powder, sugar, ghee",vegetarian,5,20,sweet,dessert,Karnataka,South,"Preparation
Firstly take all the 3 ingredients – 1.25 cups sugar (200 to 210 grams sugar), 1 cup besan (100 grams) and 1 cup ghee (200 to 210 grams).
Seive the besan once or twice. This helps in reducing the lumps if any while mixing besan in the sugar syrup.
Grease a pan or tray with some ghee. Use a pan or tray which can give you some depth and height, so that you can get rectangular or square pieces.
Making Mysore Pak
Now take the sugar in a heavy thick bottomed kadai. Since a lot of stirring happens, I would suggest you to Use a heavy and large aluminium or iron kadai. please do not use non stick pan as due to the heat and lot of stirring, the non stick coating can get affected.
Add ½ cup water in the sugar.
Keep the pan on the stove top. On a medium-low or medium flame, heat the sugar syrup.
Stir so that the sugar dissolves.
Meanwhile also take the ghee in another pan and keep it on stove top. let the ghee melt on a low flame or sim. The ghee has to be hot when we add it in the besan mixture. So let it be on a slow simmer.

AD
Let the sugar syrup start bubbling and boiling. We are not looking for one string consistency in the sugar syrup. Just let the sugar solution come to a boil and then add the besan.
Add the besan in three to four parts. first add some of the besan.
With a wired whisk, stir the besan briskly, so that it dissolves with the sugar solution.
With one hand, add the besan and with the other hand mix it with a wired whisk.
Finish of all the besan this way.
Stir very well, so that the besan has got mixed evenly with the sugar syrup. 
Adding Ghee
Then add ghee in parts. First add a ladle full of the ghee.
You will see a lot of bubbles and frothing in the besan mixture after you add ghee.
As soon as you add ghee, mix it with the besan with a spoon or spatula. with one hand add ghee and with the other hand mix it.
Then add the second part of ghee and again mix it very well. Keep the flame to a medium-low or medium.
This way finish off adding all the ghee in parts. Mix very well.
Do use a bigger kadai and also some gloves on your hands, as there is a lot of sizzling, frothing and bubbling that happens.
All the ghee will be absorbed first and what you will see is a smooth molten besan mixture.
On a medium-low to medium flame with non-stop stirring cook the besan mixture.
You have to continue to cook and stir till you start seeing many bubbles in the mixture and the ghee is released from it. So continue to cook and stir. the mixture will also start to leave the sides of the kadai or pan.
While stirring also scrape the bottom of the kadai and the sides. If you do not scrape, then the mixture starts sticking and gets browned or burnt.
So you have to non stop stir and scrape. do use flat steel spatula (palta) as this helps in scraping the besan mixture.
When the mixture comes together in one mass and you see some ghee at the sides, then also continue to stir and scrape.
When you see many small bubbles and holes in the mixture, then switch off the flame.
If you cook too much, then you will get a very hard mysore pak.
Setting Mysore Pak
Immediately and quickly tilt the kadai and pour the whole mixture in the pan. It falls in one lot and you don’t need to use any spoon for it.
Level with a spatula or the back of small glass or a small steel bowl.
Let the mysore pak mixture become warm or cool down. 
If there is too much ghee at the sides or top, then invert the pan after 20 to 30 minutes, so that the excess ghee is removed. You can use this ghee while preparing dosa or greasing idli plates.
Once warm or cooled down, then just invert the pan on a chopping board or tray or plate. Tap the sides and the bottom of the pan. the mysore pak block falls of easily.
Then slice the mysore pak into rectangular or square pieces.
Store in an air-tight container. It stays good for about a week to ten days at room temperature.

Add the fried coconut pieces along with the remaining oil in the batter.
Then add 1 teaspoon black sesame seeds, ½ teaspoon cumin powder, ½ teaspoon dry ginger powder, ¼ teaspoon baking soda. You can also add a pinch of salt if you want. Baking soda can be skipped too, but adding them makes the appams have a soft texture.
Mix very well.

Now heat the appe chatti pan. Add ½ to 1 teaspoon coconut oil in each mould. Keep the flame to a low. 
When the oil becomes hot, with a spoon pour batter in the chatti moulds till ¾ of each mould.
On a low to medium-low flame cook till the base is golden and crisp.
Then turn over each unniyapam with a wooden skewer or stick.
You can turn over a couple of times more for even cooking.
Once golden and crisp from all sides, then place the unni appams on kitchen paper towels. Prepare unniappam with the remaining batter in the same way. If there is oil in the moulds, then no need to add extra oil.
Serve unniappam warm or at room temperature as a sweet snack. You can even place them in a casserole. In the casserole these appams stay warm for some time. 
The recipe makes for 28 unniyappam. These stay good at room temperature for 1 to 2 days. You can even refrigerate them."

Anarsa,"Rice flour, jaggery, khus-khus seeds",vegetarian,10,50,sweet,dessert,Maharashtra,West,"To begin making Traditional Anarsa Recipe With Curd (Apoopa), wash and soak the rice in water for 3 days. Change the water every day. On the 4th day, drain the rice and spread it on a colander. 

After 2-3 hrs, grind this rice to a fine powder in a mixer. (If grinding in a flour mill can allow the rice to dry completely, but if grinding at home in a food processor or grinder do not allow the rice to dry out completely, otherwise it may take long time for grinding).

Sieve the rice powder through a fine mesh ( the one used for sieving all purpose flour)

Now weigh this rice powder. The castor sugar to be added has to be half the quantity of rice flour. Reserve some 50 grams of this rice powder and add the castor sugar in the remaining rice powder and mix well.

Add 1/2 tablespoon curd and 1 tablespoon ghee to it and knead the mixture. Be careful while adding curd as addition of more curd will make the sugar in the mixture to melt and the mixture will become sticky. Keep the dough covered for 1 day or so. 

Next day take a plate or plastic sheet and sprinkle poppy seeds on it.

Now apply ghee to your palm to avoid dough sticking, pinch out a small portion from the dough and make small lemon size ball from it and press it lightly on the poppy seeds. Flatten the dough into a roundel.

In case if the dough ball holds its size but becomes too hard after frying, it means we have to add little caster sugar to the dough.

Heat enough ghee in a deep frying pan. Keep the medium flame throughout frying process.

Fry the Anarsa in the ghee with the Poppy seeds side up. Keep on splashing ghee over the upper side of the Anarsa with the ladle without disturbing the Anarsa. Fry till the Anarsa is golden brown. The poppy seeds side of the Anarsa will have a sort of mesh on it once it is fried. Be careful with the ghee temperature here. Heat it on a medium flame or else the Anarsa will break.

Remove the Anarsa and drain the ghee. To drain the ghee keep the Anarsa in a vertical position. Similarly shallow fry rest of the Anarsa , keep on adding ghee after frying 2-3 Anarsa in the frying pan.  Cool down all the Anarsa till they become crisp. Store it in an airtight container. "

Modak,"Rice flour, coconut, jaggery ",vegetarian,10,15,sweet,dessert,Maharashtra,West,"Making Sweet Stuffing
Heat ghee in a pan. Keep flame to a low. Add poppy seeds. Fry for some seconds till the poppy seeds start crackling. 
Then add grated fresh coconut, jaggery, cardamom powder and grated nutmeg. Mix well and cook this coconut-jaggery mixture on a low flame. The jaggery will melt first.
Stirring often cook this mixture for 7 to 9 minutes till the moisture from the jaggery begins to dry. Switch off the flame. Don’t overcook as the jaggery then hardens. Keep this coconut-jaggery filling aside. On cooling, the mixture will thicken more.
You can also add a bit of rice flour to this mixture. This is an optional step. The rice flour helps to absorb moisture, if any from the filling. Keep the filling aside to cool.
Making Rice Flour Dough
In a pan add water, oil or ghee and salt. Keep it on the stove top. Let this mixture come to a boil.
Reduce the flame and add the rice flour gradually. Quickly stir and mix the flour with the water. Stir till all the rice flour is mixed with the water.
Switch off the flame. Remove the pan from the stove top and then cover this pan with a lid for 4 to 5 minutes.
Now take all the dough in a large plate or thali or in a bowl. Gather the dough together and begin to knead it.
The dough will be hot when, you begin to knead. So apply some water on your palms and knead the dough. Knead the dough very well. If you feel the dough looks dense or hard or dry, then just add a few teaspoons of warm water and continue to knead.
Make small balls from the dough. Roll the balls till smooth in your palms. You can also apply some water on your palms, while rolling the balls. Keep the balls covered with a kitchen towel. The balls should be smooth in appearance and should not have any cracks.
Making Modak Without Mould
Take a ball and flatten it with your fingers to a round disc or a shallow bowl shape. You can apply ghee or oil in your palms while flattening. Place the sweet filling in the center.
Flute and press the edges. Bring together all the edges and join them. Remove the extra portion of the dough from the top, if any. Shape and taper the top of the modak with your fingers.
Making Modak With Mould
Grease the modak mould with a bit of ghee or oil. Then close or lock the mould. Put the dough ball inside the mould and press it so that a space is made. Place the sweet stuffing.
Cover the bottom with a small piece of dough. Press and smoothen it sealing the modak.
Open or unlock the modak mould. Remove the modak gently from the mould. Shape all modaks this way with mould. Keep the shaped modak covered with a napkin so that the rice dough does not dry out.  Make all the modak this way.
Steaming Modak
Grease a steamer pan lightly with oil or ghee. Place the shaped modak in the greased pan with some space between them. Cover with a kitchen napkin.
Take 2 to 2.5 cups water in a pot, pressure cooker or an Instant Pot steel insert. Place a trivet or a rack. Heat the water on high flame until begins to boil. For instant pot, use the sauté option and let the water begin to boil.
The water should be hot or boiling when you place the modak in the large pan. Cover the pan and steam modak for 10 to 15 minutes on a medium-low flame. On the Instant Pot, use the steam function on high for steaming and keep the steam vent in venting position so that the steam releases while steaming. Use a stop watch to set the time to 10 or 12 minutes. 
Once the ukadiche modak are steamed, you can drizzle a few teaspoons of ghee on them. Some modak may crack while shaping or steaming, buts it is fine. You can forgive yourself if you are making this first time."

Shrikhand,"Curd, sugar, saffron, cardamom",vegetarian,10,720,sweet,dessert,Maharashtra,West,"Making Hung Curd
First line the strainer on a deep bowl. Then line a muslin cheesecloth or kitchen cotton towel on the strainer.
Pour the fresh curd. Do use fresh curd and not one which has gone sour.
Bring the four edges of the muslin together and tie one edge tightly around the rest.
Gently press and you will see the whey dripping.
Now place a heavy bowl or lid or tray on the tied muslin. If you have a hook, you can also hung the muslin in your refrigerator. Now keep the whole thing in the fridge for 4 to 5 hours or overnight.
I kept for 24 hours. Do use a deep bowl below, so that there is some distance between the curd in the strainer and the collected whey. Otherwise the whey will touch the strainer as well as the curd. Thus there will be some whey in the curd.
Next day the whey will be drained and the hung curd will be ready. Use the collected nutrient rich greenish whey in your everyday food like preparing chapatis, gravies, rice dishes, dals etc.

With a silicon spatula, collect the hung curd in a container or lidded bowl if not using it. Cover with its lid and then refrigerate. With the hung curd you can now proceed to make the shrikhand.

Mix very well. Check taste and add more salt or spice powders if required.
Making Potato Mixture
Meanwhile drain the water from the potatoes as well and let them become warm.
When the potatoes are warm, then peel them and grate. I find it easier to grate the potatoes and then mash them. However, you can also chop them and mash with a potato masher. Let the grated or mashed potatoes cool completely.
After the mashed potatoes have cooled completely, add the following ingredients: red chilli powder or cayenne pepper, garam masala powder or curry powder, coriander powder, dry mango powder, black salt and regular salt as per taste.
Next add bread crumbs and arrowroot flour. Instead of arrowroot flour, you can also add rice flour, corn flour (corn starch) or tapioca starch or roasted besan (roasted chickpea flour or roasted gram flour).

Then add the ground onion-tomato paste. Be careful as the paste splutters when you add it to the oil.
Stir and then add the malai (which is a thick layer of cream that is formed on the top of whole milk when it is boiled and later cooled). Swap it with almond powder or cashew powder or heavy cream. You can choose to skip cream altogether.
Saute the ground paste till the oil releases from the sides. The masala paste will also thicken, become glossy and will come together.
The mixture splutters initially. So do cover partly with a lid. Once the mixture stops spluttering, then remove the lid and saute.
Once the paste has been sauteed well then add the asafoetida powder, red chilli powder and turmeric powder.
Stir and then add the peas and potatoes. Saute for a minute. Add water and salt as required.

Remove the leaves from the stems of the methi/fenugreek leaves. This can take a good amount of time, and I like to prepare a large batch at once to keep in the fridge for about a week or so and have ready as needed.
After plucking the leaves rinse them thoroughly in cool running water in a large bowl. Firstly soak the leaves in enough water for a few minutes. Add some vinegar and baking soda to the water. This gets rid of pesticides if any.
Swish and move them with your hands, so that they are cleaned thoroughly of any soil or mud clinging on the stems. This needs to get washed off. See that the leaves are clean and devoid of any muddy particles on them.
Drain all the water and soak them in fresh water for a few more minutes. Drain the water. Repeat this process once or twice. Finally, drain all the water.
Now chop the fenugreek leaves. You could do this with a knife or chop them in a food processor. While chopping in the food processor, make sure you do not chop it to fine or make a paste of it.
Preparing Potatoes
Rinse, peel and chop the potatoes into small cubes or squares.
In a heavy skillet, kadai or pan, heat up the oil. Add the potatoes first.
Saute the potatoes for some minutes on medium-low to medium heat until they start looking crisp and are lightly browned from the edges.

When the methi begins to produce water, reduce the heat to low and cook for 5 to 6 more minutes on a low to medium-low heat.
The liquid should be totally evaporated in the dish and the fenugreek leaves will become completely wilted. Saute for a couple more minutes to get the potatoes and methi nice and dry.
If your potatoes are not quite cooked when the liquid has dried up, add a tablespoon or so of water and continue to cook. Later, if you see any extra water in the pan, then simmer until all the water is dried up.
Once cooked, you can either mix in a bit of butter for extra rich flavor or serve plain as-is. "

Chana masala,"Chickpeas, tomato paste, garam masala, ginger, red onion, avocado oil",vegetarian,20,30,spicy,main course,Punjab,North,"Soaking And Cooking White Chickpeas
Rinse the chickpeas a couple of times in fresh water. Then soak them in water overnight or for 8 to 9 hours. Add enough amount of water as the chickpeas increase in size after soaking it. Later drain the water and again rinse the soaked chickpeas with fresh water.
To give a dark color to the chickpeas, traditionally dried amla (Indian gooseberries) are added. These also give a faint sourness to the stock. If you do not have dried amla, then add 1 black tea bag.
In a 3-litre stovetop pressure cooker add the chickpeas along with the 3 to 4 dried amla pieces or 1 black tea bag. Taj tea bags work very well. Then add water.
Season with salt and pressure cook the chickpeas for 12 to 15 whistles on medium heat. The chickpeas should be cooked well and softened. The chickpeas should be soft when you mash it with a spoon or eat it. The chickpeas should not give you a bite when you eat it.
Dry Roasting Spices
In a pan, take all the whole spices for the ""chole masala powder"" mentioned above and on a low heat begin to roast them.
Stir often and roast the spices till they get extra browned. Don’t burn them. You have to go beyond a point roasting them even after they become fragrant and they get more browned than what is the norm usually.
Let these roasted spices cool and then grind or powder them finely in a coffee grinder or in a dry grinder.
By now the chana will be cooked. You will see a darker brown shade in the safed (white chana). Remove the amla pieces which would have softened by now or the tea bag from the stock.
Making Chana Masala
Heat oil in a pan or kadai. Add ginger-garlic paste and saute for few seconds or till their raw aroma goes away.
Then add chopped onions and saute stirring often till the onions turn translucent or light brown.
Add tomatoes and saute stirring often till they soften and the oil starts to leave the sides of the onion and tomato mixture.
Lower the heat and then add all of the powdered chole masala that we ground, together with the red chili powder, turmeric powder and garam masala powder (optional).
Stir and mix the dry ground spices and then add slit green chilies
Add the cooked chickpeas. Mix well.
Add salt according to taste. Then add about 1 to 1.25 cups of the stock in which the chickpeas was cooked. You can also add water instead.

Cooking Chole Masala
Simmer on a low to medium heat. You can also cook the chana masala without the lid. 
The gravy will thicken and reduce. Mash a few chickpeas as this helps in thickening the gravy. 
Simmer till you get the consistency you prefer. The consistency of this curry is not thin, but medium consistency or semi-dry. For thick or semi-dry consistency add less water.
If you have not added dry pomegranate seeds while roasting the spices, then you need to add amchur powder (dry mango powder) now. Mix and stir well.
Serve the Punjabi chana masala with kulcha, bhatura, poori, roti, naan, bread with a side of sliced onions, tomatoes and lemon or lime wedges. 
While serving garnish with coriander leaves and ginger julienne.

Chapati,"Whole wheat flour, olive oil, hot water, all purpose flour",vegetarian,10,10,-1,main course,Maharashtra,West,"Knead the dough
Take 2 cups (270 grams) atta in a large bowl. Usually a round flat plate with shallow edges called paraat is used but I just had a round mixing bowl so that's what I used.
You can add little oil if you like here, I did not add any.
Start adding water, little by little. As you add water, mix with your hands and bring the dough together. I needed around 3/4 cup (180 ml) +1 tablespoon (15 ml) water here. You may need more or less water depending on the kind of flour.
Once the dough comes together, start kneading the dough. Knead with the knuckles of your finger, applying pressure.
Fold the dough using your palms and knead again applying pressure with your knuckles.
Keep kneading until the dough feels soft and pliable. If it feels hard/tight, add little water and knead again. If it feels too sticky/soft, add some dry flour and mix.
Once done, the dough should be smooth. Press the dough with your fingers, it should leave an impression.
Cover the dough with a damp cloth or paper towel for 20 to 30 minutes.
I placed my paper towel under tap water and then squeezed all the water from it and used that damp paper towel to cover the cloth.
Roll the roti
After the dough has rested, give it a quick knead again.
Divide the dough into 12 equal parts, each weighing around 35 to 37 grams.
Start working with one ball, while keep the remaining dough balls covered with a damp cloth so that they don't dry out.
Take one of the balls and press it between your fingers to make it smooth. Then roll it between your palms to make it round and smooth. There should be no cracks. Press the round dough ball and flatten it slightly.
Now take around 1/4 cup atta in a plate for dusting the roti while rolling it. Dip the prepared dough ball into the dry flour and dust it from all sides.
Then start rolling the roti, using a rolling board and rolling pin.
Move the rolling pin lengthwise across the dough applying gentle pressure as you roll. If you are rolling it correctly, the dough will move in circular motion on its own and the roti will roll evenly. This comes with practice.
You can also roll a little and then take the roti and move it a little with your hands and roll again. Roll it thin until you have a 5 to 6 inch diameter circular roti.
You will have to dip the roti in dry flour several time while rolling the roti. Anytime the dough starts sticking to the rolling pin, dip the roti into the atta from both sides and then continue rolling.
Cook the roti
Heat the tawa (skillet) on medium-high heat. Make sure the tawa is hot enough before you place the roti on the tawa.
Dust excess flour off the rolled roti and place it on the hot tawa.
Let it cook for 15-30 seconds until you see some bubbles on top side. At this point flip the roti, you don't want the first side to cook too much.
Now, let the other side cook more than the first side, around 30 seconds more. Use a tong to see how much it has cooked from the second side now. If you see brown spots all over, means it has cooked enough.
Now, remove the roti from the tawa using a tong and place it directly on flame with the first side (which was little less cooked) directly on the flame.
The roti if rolled evenly will puff up, flip with a tong to cook the other side as well. The roti is done when it has brown spots, don't burn it.
Apply ghee on the rotis immediately. Make all the roti/phulka similarly. Serve warm."

If you’re using wooden skewers, place them in water to soak while the chicken is marinating. This will help to prevent them burning during grilling.
Remove the marinated chicken from the fridge and thread onto skewers.
Brush the chicken with the oil, then place on a griddle plate and cook, turning a couple of times, for 8-10 minutes until cooked through. Alternatively, you can grill (broil) under a grill, or you can barbecue for the same amount of time.

Dal makhani,"Red kidney beans, urad dal, cream, garam masala, chili powder",vegetarian,10,60,sweet,main course,Punjab,North,"Preparation
Soak both the whole urad dal and rajma overnight in enough water for 8 to 9 hours or overnight. Later drain them well.
Rinse both the lentils a couple of times in water.
Drain again and then add them in a 3 litre pressure cooker. Add water and stir well.
Pressure cook for 18 to 20 whistles on a high flame, till both the urad dal and rajma have cooked thoroughly and softened. If they are not cooked, then add about ½ cup water again and pressure cook for 4 to 5 whistles more.
The urad dal should melt in the mouth and should not give any bite or resistance when eaten. You can also just mash the urad dal with a spoon or with your fingers to check the doneness. The same rule applies for rajma too. Keep the cooked beans aside.
In a blender or mixer jar, take chopped tomatoes and blend to a smooth puree. Set aside.
You can also add ready 1 cup tomato puree instead of blending the tomatoes. No need to blanch the tomatoes while pureeing.
Making Dal Makhani
In a pan, now heat butter. You can use salted butter or unsalted butter.
Add the whole spices – cumin seeds, cloves, green cardamoms, black cardamom, 1 inch cinnamon, 1 small to medium tej patta.
Fry for some seconds till the spices sputter and become aromatic.
Add finely chopped onions.
Stir and sauté the onions on a low or medium-low heat often till they become light golden.
Add the ginger garlic paste. Stir again and sauté for some seconds till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.
Add the chopped green chilies and sauté for a minute.
Add the prepared tomato puree and mix well.
Add red chili powder and 2 to 3 pinches of grated nutmeg or nutmeg powder.
Stir very well and sauté this mixture on a low to medium flame, till you see fat releasing from the sides.
Then add the cooked urad dal and rajma beans along with the stock. Also add 1 cup water or as required.
Slow Cooking
Stir very well and simmer the dal makhani uncovered on a low flame.
Keep on stirring often, so that the lentils don’t stuck to the bottom of the pan.
Once it has begun to thicken, add salt as required.
Stir very well and continue to simmer on a low flame. Keep on stirring when the lentils are simmered on low heat.
When simmering you can add more water if the gravy looks thick or dry. The longer you keep dal makhani to simmer, the better it tastes.
I kept it for about an overall 25 minutes on a low flame. Do keep on stirring at intervals.
When the gravy has thickened enough, then add cream. Dal makhani is not too thick or too thin. It has a medium consistency.
Mix the cream very well. Then switch off the heat.
Add crushed kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves). Mix again.
Cover and set dal makhani aside, if you are proceeding to the dhungar method. Or else you can serve dal makhni straight away.
Dhungar Method
Heat a small piece of charcoal on flame till it becomes red hot. With the help of tongs, keep on turning the charcoal piece so that it evenly burns.
Keep the red hot charcoal in a small bowl.
Pour ½ teaspoon oil on the hot charcoal.
Immediately keep this bowl on top of the dal makhani.
Cover for a minute and allow the charcoal to infuse its smoke in the dal makhni. Remove the bowl. Stir again.
Serve punjabi dal makhani garnished with chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) and a few teaspoons of cream with naan, roti, paratha or steamed rice."
Dal tadka,"Pigeon peas, garam masala, ginger, red onion, kasuri methi",vegetarian,10,30,spicy,main course,Punjab,North,"Cook Lentils
1. Thoroughly rinse 1 cup tuvar dal (arhar dal, or split & husked pigeon pea lentils) in water. Add them to a 3-litre pressure cooker.
No pressure cooker? You can also cook the lentils in a pot. Soak the lentils for an hour or two before you cook them in a pot.
2. Add ½ cup chopped onions, 1 cup finely chopped tomatoes, 1 or 2 green chilies (1 teaspoon of chopped Anaheim pepper or Serrano pepper can be subbed for green chillies) and 1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger.
3. Pour 2.5 cups of water into the pressure cooker.
If cooking in a pot, then about 4 to 4.5 cups of water can be added.
4. Add ½ turmeric powder and 1 pinch of asafoetida (hing). If you do not have asafoetida, then skip it.
5. Mix well.
6. Pressure cook the lentils for about 7-8 whistles, or until they become soft and creamy.
Mash the cooked lentils with a wired whisk or with a spoon and keep aside. If the consistency looks thick, then add about ½ – 1 cup water (depending on the thickness) to get a medium consistency. Simmer dal for 3 to 4 minutes.
7. Once the desired consistency is reached, add 1-2 tablespoons low-fat cream (optional), ½ teaspoon garam masala powder, 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) and salt to taste. Switch off the the heat.
8. Mix well so that everything combines uniformly. Taste and adjust salt before adding tadka.
Smoke Lentils Using Dhungar Method (Optional)
10. To get the smoky fumes of burnt charcoal like you would in a restaurant, you'll want to follow the dhungar method. Using tongs, place a small piece of charcoal on a grill pan like shown in the photo below. Burn the charcoal till it becomes red hot.
Please be sure to use natural charcoal for this method, avoiding anything that has a flame accelerant added.
Note that this is an optional step – you can proceed directly to the tempering method.
11. Place the red hot charcoal in a small steel bowl. You can also use a halved hollow onion instead of the bowl.
12. Pour about ¼ tsp of oil or ghee on the charcoal. You will see fumes emanating as soon as you pour oil or ghee on the hot charcoal.
13. Place this bowl on the dal.
14. Cover the cooker or pot with a lid and let the dal get infused. Only smoke for 1-2 minutes. Do not keep for a long time, or you'll risk making the dal taste bitter.
Remove the bowl carefully with the help of tongs and cover the cooker with a lid. Set aside.
Make The Tempering (Tadka Or Chaunk)
15. Next, heat 3 tablespoons oil or ghee (clarified butter) in a small pan over low-medium heat. First, add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds and crackle them. The cumin should get fried and not be raw, but be careful not burn them.
16. Now add 2 to 3 dry red chilies, a generous pinch of asafoetida, and 5-6 medium sized garlic cloves which have been finely chopped. Let the garlic brown lightly and the red chilies change color. Do not burn the garlic.
17. Lastly, add 1 teaspoon crushed kasuri methi (fenugreek seeds) and ½ teaspoon red chili powder or cayenne pepper. Mix well and turn off the stove.
18. Pour entire tempering along with the oil or ghee into the dal.
19. You can either mix the dal with tempering, or serve the dal tadka with the tempering on top it. I personally like the aesthetic of having the tadka floating on top. Garnish with coriander leaves. Enjoy!
Serving Suggestion: Serve dal tadka hot with steamed basmati rice or jeera rice (cumin rice), or with roti, naan or paratha."

Peel the potatoes. This task takes a lot of time, so do it while listening to music or watching your favorite tv show. If you want you can keep the peels too.
With a fork, tooth pick or skewer, poke holes in the potatoes all over. Halve them or you can keep them whole if they are small. This is done so that when cooking on dum, the potatoes absorb the flavors of the masala in which they are getting cooked.
Whisk the fresh full fat curd or yogurt till smooth. Keep aside.
In a small bowl, take kashmiri red chili powder and water.
Mix and stir well to get a smooth mixture.
Frying Potatoes
In a pan heat mustard oil till it begins to smoke.
Add the parboiled peeled potatoes and begin to fry them on a low to medium flame.
With a slotted spoon, turn them over while frying, when one side is light golden.
Remove the potatoes which are golden and crisp with a slotted spoon. Fry them well or else they remain uncooked from the center.
Place them on kitchen paper towels. Fry all the potatoes till golden and crisp.
If you want you can again poke holes in the fried potatoes. This is an optional step.

After adding curd, add water and continue to stir.
Stir and mix very well.
Then add fennel powder. If you do not have ready fennel powder than you have to make it. Roast the fennel lightly on a pan or tava. When cooled, then in a mortar & pestle pound the roasted fennel seed to a medium fine powder. You can also grind in a small spice grinder or coffee grinder.
Add the whole spices and ginger powder. Stir well.
Now add the potatoes. Again stir.
Season with salt and stir again.
Cover the pan tightly with a lid. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes on a low to medium flame. Here we are cooking the potato gravy on dum.
The gravy should become thick. 
You can always add less or more water depending on how thick or thin you want the gravy. If you cook more, then the gravy will reduce more. So depending on what you prefer, you can cook for less or more time.
Sprinkle some caraway seeds from top (optional) and serve kashmiri dum aloo hot with naan, rotis or rice"

Now make small balls from this moong dal mixture. You can also spread some oil on your palms while making the balls. Keep aside. 
Assembling, Stuffing And Shaping
After 30 minutes, lightly knead the dough.
Roll the dough into a log. Now cut the dough in equal portions. This will depend on the number of moong dal mixture balls that were made. take a portion of the cut dough and flatten it with your fingers. Keep the edges thin while flattening. You can also use a rolling pin (belan) to flatten.
Now place the moong dal stuffing ball on the dough. Flatten the moong dal stuffing ball.
Bring the edges of the dough together and join them at the center. Excess dough can be pinched off and removed.
Flatten the top and then gently roll the kachori with a rolling pin to get a medium thickness kachori. Stuff and prepare all kachori this way. Keep them covered under a moist muslin or cotton cloth, so that they do not dry up.
Frying Kachori
Heat oil for frying and keep the flame to a low. When the oil is just hot enough, you can add the kachoris.
When the kachori start puffing up, then gently nudge each kachori with a spoon, so that they puff up well.
When the base becomes light golden, then gently turn them over. The frying takes about 7 to 9 minutes. So one has to be patient.
Continue to fry on a low to low-medium flame till they become golden. While frying you can turn them often to get an even color. Regulate the temperature from low to low-medium as required.
Fry till they become golden and nicely crisp from outside.

Kadhi pakoda,"Besan, garam masala powder, gram flour, ginger, curry leaves",vegetarian,10,60,spicy,main course,Haryana,North,"Making Curd Slurry
In a bowl take the sour curd and whisk it well till smooth
Add gram flour, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder and salt to the whisked curd.
Stir and mix everything again.
Add 3 cups water and stir again.
Stir very well to make a smooth mixture without lumps. If there are lumps, then break them with a wired whisk or a spatula or with your fingers. Set the curd slurry aside.
You can use a blender to make this mixture, but make sure you don’t over do it. You will get butter instead of a smooth blended curd.
Making Pakora For Kadhi
Take the gram flour in a bowl and add carom seeds, red chili powder, garam masala powder and salt.
Add 1 cup thinly sliced onions.
Mix everything well and set aside covered for 30 minutes.
This will allow the onions to release their water in the mixture. Depending on the water content in the onions, the mixture will become very moist or just about moist.
Then accordingly add water as required to make a thick batter. I added ¼ cup water.
Heat oil for deep frying in a pan or kadai. Let the oil become medium hot. Then with a spoon carefully drop the pakora batter in the oil.
When the pakora are partly cooked, then turn over and fry the other side.
Fry till the pakora are crisp and golden.
Remove the fried pakora and place them on a kitchen paper towel so that extra oil is absorbed. Fry the pakora in batches this way. When done set all of them aside.
Making Kadhi
In another pan or kadai, heat mustard oil. Make sure to use a large bottomed pot so that while boiling, the kadhi does not spill.
Add the cumin seeds, fenugreek seeds and asafoetida. Allow the cumin seeds to crackle and the fenugreek seeds to change their color. Fry on a low flame, so that these spices do not get burnt.

Then add chopped ginger, chopped garlic and chopped green chillies. Stir and sauté for a minute.
Now add curry leaves, dry red chilies (halved or broken and seeds removed). Stir and sauté for a minute on a low flame.
Then add the curd slurry.
Stir very well.
Increase the flame to medium and bring the kadhi to a boil. Keep on stirring often so that the bottom does not get browned. Time taken to cook kadhi will be around 14 to 16 minutes.
After the kadhi has come to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for more 6 to 7 minutes. The kadhi will thicken. 
If the kadhi becomes too thick, then add some hot water.
Making Kadhi Pakora
Now add the onion pakora to the kadhi and stir gently.
Cover with a lid and let the onion pakora be soaked in it for 8 to 10 minutes.
Lastly sprinkle some garam masala powder.

Rinse and wash moong lentils and rice together. 
Soak both rice and lentils for 30 minutes in water.
After 30 minutes, drain all the water and set aside.
Sautéing Onions, Tomatoes, Spices
Heat ghee or oil in pressure cooker. Add cumin seeds. When cumin splutters then add onions.
Sauté onions until translucent. No need to make onions light brown or golden brown.
Once the onions become translucent, then add tomatoes, green chilli and ginger.
Mix and add turmeric powder and asafoetida. Mix again and sauté until the tomatoes softens.
Add the rice and moong lentils to the pressure cooker.
Stir and sauté for a minute. Add water and season with salt.
Mix well. Check the taste of the water and it should be slightly salty.
Cooking Khichdi
Close the lid tightly and pressure cook on a high heat for 7 to 8 whistles or 8 to 9 minutes on medium-high to high heat.
Switch off heat and wait. Let the pressure fall naturally in the cooker.
When there is no pressure in the cooker, remove the lid and check the consistency. If khichdi looks too thick, add some hot water and mix well.
Keep on sim or low heat to simmer for a few minutes until you get the right consistency.
The consistency of khichdi can be adjusted as per your choice by adding less or more water. Some people prefer thick and some thin consistency.
While serving drizzle 1 to 2 teaspoons of ghee on top while serving. Optional step.
Serve moong dal khichdi hot or warm with curd (yogurt) and accompanying salad.
Instant Pot Khichdi
Press the sauté function of your IP. Let the display read 'hot'. Add ghee or oil. Fry cumin seeds until they splutter.
Add onions and sauté until they soften. Tip in the tomatoes, ginger, green chillies and sauté stirring often until tomatoes soften. Stir in the turmeric powder and asafoetida.
Add soaked rice and lentils. Stir deglazing if needed.
Pour 3.5 cups water and salt. Deglaze removing any stuck ingredients from the bottom of the pan.
Seal with the IP lid and set the valve to the sealing position. Pressure cook on high pressure for 9 minutes. When you hear the beep sound, wait for 10 minutes and then do a quick pressure release lifting the valve carefully.
Check the khichdi consistency. If it is too thick, add some hot water and sauté for 1 to 2 minutes using the sauté function. If khichdi has a thin consistency, sauté for some more minutes until you get the desired consistency. Serve hot or warm.
Dal Khichdi In A Pan (Stove-Top)
To make khichdi in a pan, follow all the directions as listed for the pressure cooker version in a pan until you add the rice and lentils.
After you add the rice and lentils, give a good stir and sauté for a minute. Add 4 to 4.5 cups water and season with salt. Cover the pan and cook on a medium-low to medium flame until the lentils are softened and mushy.
Keep a check while cooking and if the water has dried up with undercooked lentils, add some hot water and combine well. Cover and continue to cook.
When the khichri is cooked, check the consistency. If thick, add some hot water and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes. For a thin consistency, continue too cook for some more minutes.
Serving Suggestions
The sides that that pair great and make khichdi a satisfying complete meal are Curd (yogurt), Papad (roasted or fried), Pickle and Ghee – a teaspoon or two drizzled on top of the khichdi
You can also serve it with any raita or salad. I like to to enjoy khichdi drizzled with some lemon juice and served with Eggplant Fries or Potato Fries and with a finely chopped vegetable salad.
Storage And Leftovers
I always prefer to eat and serve khichdi fresh as it can become dry and lumpy on cooling or after some hours.
If you do end up with leftovers, you can store in the refrigerator in an air-tight container for up to 1 day.
I also prefer to reheat the dish in a saucepan instead of the oven so that I can add some water to thin it a bit and ensure everything is evenly heated before serving.
On cooling khichdi does thicken and becomes lumpy, so you have to add some water to it while reheating."

Mix very well.
Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons water all over and mix the flour with water evenly. Do add more water if required. The sattu stuffing mixture should not be too dry or too wet. If the mixture is dry, then the dryness is felt when eating littis.
Stuffing & Shaping Litti
After 30 minutes, now make small or medium sized balls from the dough.
Sprinkling some flour, roll each dough ball to a circle of about 5 to 6 inches.
Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of the stuffing in the center.
Pleat and then join the edges. Press the joined part and lightly roll the stuffed dough balls in your palms, so as to get a round shape. Keep aside.
Another method is to flatten the the dough ball with your palms and make a shallow cup.
Now place the stuffing.
Gently bring together the outer dough cover in the center, while pressing the stuffing. Join and then seal the edges. This is a bit tricky method. So please use the method which suits you.
Keep the prepared littis under a cotton towel or napkin, so that the dough does not dry out.
Prepare all stuffed littis this way and place them on a baking tray, which has been greased with some oil. Do grease baking tray well, otherwise the littis can stuck to the tray.
Baking Litti
Place the littis in a preheated oven at 200 degrees celsius. Preheat the oven for 20 minutes at 200 degree celsius prior to baking.
After 10 to 15 minutes of baking, remove the tray and flip each litti. Keep the tray back in the oven.
Again after 10 to 15 minutes, remove the baking tray and flip each litti. Place the tray back in the oven. This has to be done once or twice more for even baking of littis.
Bake till the crust looks done with some light brown or golden brown spots on them. Timing will vary upon the size and litres of oven. It took me about 45 minutes for these to bake.
Brush the littis with some melted ghee all over.
This step is optional and only to get charred spots on the litti. Secure the litti in a pair of tongs and place it on fire. Rotate for a few seconds till you see some charred spots on littis.
Serve these bihari style litti with baingan chokha, aloo chokha and tamatar chokha accompanied with a small bowl of melted ghee. The litti is broken, dipped in ghee and then had with the chokha.

Boil the soaked chickpeas with the whole spices, black salt, water and tea bag in a pressure cooker for 10 to 15 minutes. If the chickpeas are not cooked completely then pressure cook them for a few more minutes.
You could also tie all the spices in a muslin and make a bouquet garni and add it to the chickpeas.
Drain all the water from the cooked chickpeas. Remove and discard the spices and tea bag.

Notes
Swap canned chickpeas with dried chickpeas. Add about 3.5 to 3.75 cups of canned chickpeas. Drain the water from the canned chickpeas and then rinse them in fresh water, before including in the recipe.
The recipe is moderately spiced, but for an even more spicy taste, increase the amount of red chili powder and chana masala powder. 
Omit the tea bags or dried amla (Indian gooseberry) if you do not prefer them. 
If in case the tea bag has burst while pressure cooking then rinse the chickpeas in a colander with water. This will rinse any of the tea particles from the cooked chickpeas.
While I have cooked the chickpeas in a stove-top pressure cooker, they can be easily cooked in an Instant Pot or in a pan on the stove-top. Add the same amount of water while cooking in either the Instant pot or in a pan. 
For a more tangy taste, add more dry mango powder. Instead of dry mango powder, you can also use dried pomegranate seeds powder (anardana powder). "

On a low heat to medium-low heat simmer without a lid for 10 to 12 minutes or more time until the curry thickens slightly. It should not be watery.
Mash a few rajma beans with the spoon. This helps to thicken the curry.
When the rajma masala has thickened and comes to the right consistency which is neither too thick nor thin, then add the crushed dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi) and cream. You can skip the cream if you prefer.
Stir and simmer for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Switch off the heat.
Serve rajma masala with steamed basmati rice, jeera rice or naan or roti or paratha. You can garnish with some coriander leaves when serving.
The rajma chawal combo makes for a filling, heathy and a comforting meal."
Rongi,"Garam masala powder, tomato, kasuri methi, cinnamon, mustard oil",vegetarian,10,30,-1,main course,Punjab,North,"Soaking
Rinse the black eyed beans for a few times in water. Soak the beans for 30 minutes in enough water. Later drain and rinse the beans again with water. Drain very well and set aside.
If you are short of time, skip the soaking and move to the sautéing step. Keep in mind that you will need to cook the black eyed beans for some more time if they have not been soaked.
Making Lobia Recipe
In a 3 litre pressure cooker or pressure pan, heat oil.
Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle.
Then add the chopped onions.
Stir and saute till the onions become translucent. Stir often while sautéing onions so that they cook evenly.
Add the chopped ginger, garlic and green chilies. Sauté for some seconds or until the raw aroma of the ginger and garlic goes away.
Then add the chopped tomatoes and mix well.
Next add the all the dry ground spices – turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder and garam masala.
Stir and sauté the masala on a low heat, till the tomatoes become soft and the entire tomato-onion mixture starts to leave the sides of the pan or cooker and you see the oil leaving from the sides. Do not rush this step.
Now add the lobia or black eyed beans. Combine and mix well.
Add 3 cups water. Add salt according to taste and stir.
Pressure cook for 9 to 10 minutes or 8 to 9 whistles on medium heat or until the beans have softened well. I cooked the beans for 8 to 9 whistles as I had soaked them for only half an hour.
If you have soaked it overnight or for 2 to 3 hours, it will take less time to cook them. The lobia should be soft enough and when pressed with your fingers, it should get mashed easily. Check the beans once they are cooked through.
Let the pressure fall naturally in the cooker and then only open the lid.
Once the lobia beans are cooked, simmer the gravy without the lid so that it gets thickened.
You can also mash a few cooked beans to thicken the lobia masala gravy.
The consistency of the lobia curry is neither thin nor thick.
Lastly add chopped coriander leaves and give a final stir. You could also garnish lobia masala with chopped coriander leaves while serving.
Serve lobia curry with roti, paratha, naan, puri, steamed rice or jeera rice.
It is best to eat this black eyed beans curry as soon as it is made. I would not recommend to store the curry in the fridge or freeze it as the taste and flavors of the beans change completely and do not taste that good after a day."
Samosa,"Potatoes, green peas, garam masala, ginger, dough",vegetarian,30,30,spicy,snack,-1,-1,"Making The Dough
Take the flour, carom seeds, salt in a bowl. Mix well and add ghee.
With your fingertips rub the ghee or oil in the flour to get a breadcrumb like consistency.
The whole mixture should clump together when joined and not fall apart.
Add water in parts and knead to a firm dough.
If the dough looks dry or floury, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons more water and knead.
Cover the dough with a moistened napkin and set aside for 30 minutes.
Making Potato Stuffing
Steam or boil the potatoes and peas till are cooked completely. Drain them of any extra water in a colander or sieve.
Peel the boiled potatoes and chop them into small cubes
Dry roast all the whole spices mentioned in the above list until fragrant taking care not to burn them.
When the spices are warm or cool at room temperature, grind them in a dry grinder or coffee grinder to a semi-fine or fine powder.
Heat oil in a pan. add the cumin seeds and crackle them.
Add the ginger and green chillies. Sauté for a few seconds until the raw aroma of ginger goes away.
Add the steamed green peas, red chili powder, the freshly ground spice powder, dry mango powder and asafoetida.
Stir and sauté on a low heat for 1 to 2 minutes.
Add the potato cubes. Mix very well and sauté for about 2 to 3 minutes on low heat with frequent stirring.
Set aside the potato filling aside to cool at room temperature.
Assembling & Shaping
After resting the dough for 30 minutes, divide the dough in 6 equal pieces.
Take each piece and roll in your palms first to make a smooth ball.
Then roll it with a rolling pin keeping the thickness to 1 mm throughout.
Cut with a knife or a pastry cutter through the center of the rolled samosa pastry.
With a brush or with your finger tips, spread some water all over the edges.
Join the two straight ends forming a cone shape.
Press the edges so that they get sealed well.
Stuff the prepared samosa cone with the prepared potato-peas stuffing.
Pinch a part on the edge (check the video & photos). This helps the samosa to stand once it is shaped.
Press both the edges. Be sure there are no cracks.
Prepare all the samosa this way and keep covered with a moist kitchen napkin.
Frying Samosa
Now heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Once the oil becomes hot (test by adding a small piece of dough – it should come up quickly once added to the hot oil). Gently slide the prepared stuffed samosa & quickly reduce the flame to low.
Turn over in between and fry until golden. Drain the fried samosa on paper towels to remove excess oil.
Fry them in batches. For frying the second batch, again increase the temperature of the oil to medium-heat. Do not overcrowd the pan while frying.
Add the samosa and then lower the flame, thereby decreasing the temperature of oil.
This way fry all the samosa in batches."

Shahi paneer,"Cottage cheese, malai, garam masala, ginger, tomato",vegetarian,20,40,spicy,main course,Punjab,North,"Preparation
Take the nuts and seeds in a bowl and rinse them a couple of times with water. Drain all the water and set aside.
Cook onions, cashews, almonds, magaz or melon seeds, ginger and garlic in 1.5 cups water for 8 to 10 minutes until the onions soften.
Strain the stock and set aside. Let the onions cool at room temperature.
Make a fine paste of the cooked onions, ginger, garlic along with the dry fruits adding 2 to 4 tablespoons of the strained water.
Whisk fresh curd (yogurt) till smooth and set aside.
Sautéing Onion Paste
Heat ghee in a frying pan on medium-low to medium heat.
Fry all the whole spices (listed in the above ingredients) until they release their aroma in the ghee. Be very attentive here, as spices are delicate and can burn quickly if you aren’t paying attention.
Add the ground onion paste and mix very well. On a low heat sauté stirring non-stop for 7 to 8 minutes or until the fat starts to leave the sides of the paste.
Add red chilli powder or cayenne pepper, garam masala powder and coriander powder. Mix well.
Adding Curd And Simmering Further

Shahi tukra,"Rose water, milk, white bread slices, saffron, almonds",vegetarian,10,30,sweet,dessert,Telangana,South,"Blanching Nuts
First heat a cup of water till it begins to boil in a microwave or stove top or electric heater.
Add the pistachios and almonds to the hot water.
Cover and keep aside for 30 mins. Then peel both and slice or chop them. Set aside.
Making Rabri For Shahi Tukda
In a broad thick bottomed pan or sauce pan or a kadai take the whole milk and bring to a boil. Stir the milk a few times when it is coming to a boil, to avoid it from getting browned or stuck to the pan.
Then add milk powder (I used nestle brand) . The addition of milk powder reduces the cooking time of rabri. Milk powder is not essential and if you don't have then also it is fine. Just that you will have to simmer the milk for some more minutes.
Add masala milk powder. Again optional and if you don't have just add a pinch of crushed saffron and ¼ teaspoon cardamom powder.
Remove the clotted cream or malai which forms on top of the milk and add it back to the milk. Also keep on scraping the dried milk from the sides and add them back to the milk.
Do stir and scrape often so that the milk does not get browned or burnt from the bottom as well as the sides.
Keep on simmering, stirring, removing the clotted cream and scraping.
Switch off when the milk has reduced to one-third of its original volume and become thickened.
Add sugar. Stir well so that the sugar dissolves.
Next add crushed saffron and kewra water (pandanus water) or rose water. Skip this step, if you have added saffron earlier.
You can also add sliced almonds and pistachios here. I did not add as I have already added homemade masala milk powder, which is finely ground dry fruits with a few fragrant spices.
It will take about 1 hour for the milk to thicken on a low to medium-low heat.
Pan Frying Bread
Slice the crusts of the bread. Cut them into squares, rectangles or triangles.
Heat 1 tablespoons of ghee in a flat pan, tava or frying pan.
Place the bread slices and on a medium-low to medium heat toast them.
When one side is browned, flip and toast the other side.
Flip once or twice more to get an even golden color and browning.
Drain the bread slices on paper towels.
Add 1 tablespoon ghee again and toast the remaining batch. Keep all the toasted bread side.
Making Sugar Syrup
Mix sugar with in a pan. You can begin with the sugar syrup when you start to toast bread slices.
Keep the sugar solution on a low heat.
The mixture would start to come to a boil.
Cook till you get a one thread consistency in the sugar syrup.
Switch off the heat, when one thread consistency is reached in the sugar syrup. Add cardamom powder and stir.
In case the syrup cools and crystallizes before you soak the bread in it, then add about 1 to 1.5 tablespoons of water and reheat the syrup until lightly hot.
Making Shahi Tukda
Now dip the bread slices in the sugar syrup. With the help of a spoon or small tongs, coat the bread slices evenly with the sugar syrup. If this is difficult for you, then just pour the sugar syrup evenly on a neatly arranged bed of bread slices.
Arrange the sugar syrup soaked bread slices neatly in a serving tray or plate.
Pour the rabri on the sugar syrup coated bread slices.
Garnish with sliced blanched almonds and pistachios.
Serve the rich royal shahi tukda.
If not serving shahi tukda immediatedly, then keep in the fridge in a covered container.
If you plan to add silver foil (chandi ka varak) then place it at the time of serving, whether serving shahi tukra chilled or warm or at room temperature."

Dosa,"Chana dal, urad dal, whole urad dal, blend rice, rock salt",vegetarian,360,90,spicy,snack,-1,South,"Soaking Lentils And Rice
In a bowl take the idli rice or parboiled rice along with the regular white rice. Instead of adding regular rice, you can also make the dosa with a total of 1 cup idli rice as I have shown in the video. The video has the recipe ingredients doubled in proportion.
To the same bowl, add urad dal and fenugreek seeds.
Rinse the rice, lentils and methi seeds together a couple of times and keep aside.
In a separate bowl, take the flattened rice.
Rinse it once or twice in water and then add rinsed flattened rice to the bowl containing the rinsed rice+lentils+methi seeds.
Pour 1.5 cups water. Mix. Cover with a lid and soak everything for 5 to 6 hours.
Making Dosa Batter
Drain all the water and add the soaked ingredients in a wet grinder jar.
Add ⅔ to ¾ cup water and grind till you get a fine grainy consistency of rice in the batter. A smooth consistency of batter is also fine. 
If the mixer gets heated up, then stop and wait for some minutes. When the mixer cools down, grind again. Depending on the jar capacity, you can grind everything once or in two batches. I ground in two batches and added overall ¾ cup water.
Now take the batter in a large bowl or pan.
Add ½ tsp rock salt. Mix very well. Cover and allow to ferment for 8 to 9 hours or more. Time of fermentation will vary depending on the temperature conditions.
A proper fermentation will double or triple up the volume of the batter and you will see tiny air pockets in the batter with a light sour aroma.
Now lightly stir the batter, before you begin to make dosa.
Making Dosa
Heat a cast iron pan. When the pan becomes hot, spread ¼ to ½ teaspoon oil all over the pan. Do keep the heat on low to low-medium heat, so that you are easily able to spread the batter. If the pan base is very thick, then keep the flame to medium.
Do not spread oil if you are using a non stick pan, as you won’t be able to spread the batter.
Now take a ladle full of the batter. Pour the dosa batter and gently spread the batter starting from the center and moving outwards.
Cover it with a lid and cook the dosa on a low to medium heat. Do regulate the flame as per the pan size and thickness.
When you see the batter on the top has cooked well and the bottom has become crisp and golden, then sprinkle ¼ to ½ teaspoon oil on the edges and center.
With the spoon spread the oil on the dosa.
Cook till the base is nicely golden and crisp. The base will leave the pan and the sides will also get separated when it gets cooked.
Fold and serve sada dosa hot. Make all dosai this way.
Serve these crisp plain dosa with sambar or potato masala or coconut chutney."
Idiappam,"Rice flour, hot water, grated coconut",vegetarian,120,30,spicy,snack,Tamil Nadu,South,"Preparation
Before you begin making the dough, grease oil on an idli pan or a steamer pan and keep ready. 
If you have banana leaves then cut them in squares and place them on the idli moulds. Grease the banana leaves with some oil.
Roasting Rice Flour For Idiyappam Recipe
Heat a kadai or pan. Keep the flame to a low and add 1 cup rice flour (130 grams).
On a low flame stirring often roast the rice flour for 4 to 5 minutes. You don't need to brown the flour. Its just lightly roasted and this helps in making soft idiyappams.
Continue to stir and roast till you see steam coming from the rice flour.
When you see steam appearing from the rice flour, then switch off the flame. Remove the rice flour in a mixing bowl or pan.
Kneading Dough For Idiyappam
In the same kadai or pan in which rice flour was roasted, add 1.25 to 1.3 cups water.
Add ¼ teaspoon salt.
Let the water come to a boil. The water has to be hot but should not be very hot. Do not allow it to come to a rolling boil. When you see tiny bubbles appearing in the water and it begins to start boiling, thats the time you switch off the flame.
Then add the hot water in the rice flour.
Begin to mix with a spoon or spatula. mix very well.
Keep on mixing and when the heat is tolerable then you can begin to knead. If you cannot knead then wait for 1 to 2 minutes and when the heat can be tolerated then start kneading. Do note that the dough has to be hot when you knead.
Knead to a smooth and soft dough. If the dough looks dry then you can sprinkle some warm water on it and continue to knead. If the dough become sticky then add a few tablespoons rice flour and knead.
Making Idiyappam
Take the disc meant for making the idiyappam and spread some water or oil on it.
Also before you start making idiyappam, heat 2 cups water in a pan or pressure cooker and let it come to a boil. Keep water on low to medium flame.
Divide the dough into 2 to 3 portions. Prepare a log from one portion and place it in the idiyappam/murukku maker. Grease the idiyappam maker with some oil or water before you place the dough in it. Cover the rest of the dough with a kitchen napkin so that they don't dry out.
Now begin to press the idiyappam/murukku maker directly on the idli moulds in a concentric round circle.
Form one roundel of the idiyappam.
While making idiyappams, the dough has to be hot or warm.
This way continue to make idiyappams on all the idli moulds.
Sprinkle some grated coconut on top of each idiappam. Coconut is optional and can be skipped. Alternatively you can sprinkle fresh grated coconut and sugar just before serving.
Now place the idli stand in the pan.
Cover pan with a lid. If using pressure cooker, then remove the whistle (vent weight) and cover the cooker.
On medium to high flame steam idiyappams for 9 to 10 minutes. After they are cooked well, switch off the flame and let the idiyappams be inside the steamer pan for 1 to 2 minutes.

Uttapam,"Chana dal, urad dal, thick poha, tomato, butter",vegetarian,10,20,spicy,snack,-1,South,"Soaking Rice And Lentils
In a bowl take the usked whole urad dal and fenugreek seeds. You can also use split husked urad dal instead of husked whole urad dal.
Rinse both the urad dal and methi seeds for a couple of times.
Then soak them in 1 cup water for 4 to 5 hours.
In another bowl take the parboiled rice or idli rice. Rinse the parboiled rice or idli rice for a couple of times and keep aside.
Add 2 cups of water. Mix well and soak everything for 4 to 5 hours.
Blending And Fermenting Batter
Strain the urad dal and reserve the water. Keep this water for blending/grinding the dal.
Use the wet grinding blade in the jar for grinding both urad dal and rice. Add the strained urad dal in the grinder or blender jar.
First add ¼ cup of the reserved water and blend for some seconds. Then add the rest of ¼ cup water and continue to blend till the batter is light, smooth and fluffy. If the mixer becomes too hot while blending, then stop for a few minutes. Let the mixer cool down and blend again.
Quantity of water depends on the freshness of urad dal. So add water as required.
Pour the urad dal batter in a large bowl or pan. The batter should be fluffy, smooth and light.
To the same jar, add half of the rice.
Then add ¼ to ½ cup water and blend till smooth. A fine grainy consistency of rice is also fine in the batter. You can blend the rice in two to three batches. I blend in two batches. For rice I always end up adding overall ¾ cup water and a few tablespoons more of the water at times.
Pour the rice batter in the bowl containing the urad dal batter.
Add 1 teaspoon rock salt or as per taste. In very cold temperatures, avoid adding salt. Instead add ¼ teaspoon sugar. Sugar aids in the fermentation process.
Mix both the batters very well with your hands or a spoon or spatula.
Cover and allow the batter to ferment overnight for 8 to 20 hours. The timing will vary depending on the temperature conditions in your city.
The batter should increase in volume and double or triple. It will also hava a pleasant sour aroma and many tiny air pockets.
Just lightly stir the batter. Check the consistency. If the batter looks too thick, you can add about ⅛ to ¼ cup water or more if required. Mix well.
Making Uttapam
Heat up a tawa or a cast iron pan, brush or spread some oil on the tawa. Pour the batter with a ladle or spoon. For non stick pan, you need not grease the pan. The tawa has to be hot. While making uttapams, you can regulate the flame from low to high. Before pouring the batter, reduce the flame to low.
Gently spread the batter to a thick pancake. Note that the quantity of batter to make uttapam will be more than what you would normally use for a dosa. The uttapam should be thick.
Cook them on a medium flame. Drizzle some oil on the top and sides.
These takes a longer time to cook than dosas. Cook till the base is golden.
Then flip and cook the other side.
Both sides should be cooked well. Prepare the uthappam this way with the rest of the batter. You can also make idlis or paniyarams or punugulu with this batter.
Serve Uthappam hot or warm with coconut chutney and sambar. You can also pack them in tiffin box as they remain soft even after cooling.
Making Onion Uttapam
Before pouring the batter, reduce the flame to low. Pour the batter with a ladle or spoon. Gently spread the batter to a thick pancake.
First method to make onion uttapam: Add some chopped onions on the uttapam as soon as you spread the batter. Lightly press the onions on the uttapam so that they stick to the batter. You can even sprinkle a pinch of salt.
Drizzle with some oil on the sides and on the uttapam. Cook on a medium flame.
When the base becomes golden and crisp, gently flip it with a spatula. Cook the side with the onions till the onions caramelize.
You can even gently press with the spatula so that some uncooked batter also gets cooked well. If the uttapam is not cooked well, there will be raw uncooked batter in the center. So do make sure to cook it properly.
Flip over to check if this side is cooked well. The onions will also be caramelized. You can caramelize the onions more if you want.
Second method to make onion uttapam: In a plate take 1 cup chopped onions, 2 or 3 chopped green chilies, 12 to 15 curry leaves (chopped) and ⅓ cup chopped coriander leaves.
Mix very well and keep aside.
Spread the batter on the tawa and top the onion mixture on the uttapam.
Drizzle some oil on the sides and top. Cook it on a medium-low to medium flame.
Then turn over and cook till the uttapam as well as the onions are caramelized.
Serve onion uttapam hot or warm with coconut chutney and sambar.
Making Onion Tomato Uttapam
Mix the chopped onions, tomatoes, green chili, coriander together in a bowl.
Spread the batter on the tawa or skillet.
Top with the onion, tomatoes and chili mixture.
Sprinkle a bit of pav bhaji masala or sambar masala or idli podi and salt on top of the veggies and uttapam. You can even sprinkle a pinch of salt.
Add some oil or ghee or butter on the sides and top of the uttapam.
Flip when the base is cooked and golden.
Cook the side with the onions and tomatoes till the onions are softened or caramelized.
Flip again if you see that the first side is not cooked or browned.
When the onion tomato uttapam is crisp and cooked on both sides, then serve it hot with hot sambar and coconut chutney. You could also serve them with curd chutney or simple sweetened or plain curd.
Serve them hot to have best taste. They won't taste so good once when cooled."
Vada,"Urad dal, ginger, curry leaves, green chilies, black pepper",vegetarian,15,20,spicy,snack,-1,South,"Making Vada Batter
Rinse urad dal a couple of times in fresh water. Then soak the lentils for 4 hours or overnight.
Grind or blend the soaked lentils to a smooth batter with water.
If the batter becomes watery, then the instant relief would be to add some semolina or urad dal flour or rice flour to it.
Add all the spices, herbs and salt. Mix well.
Take a bowl of water. Apply some water from the bowl on both your palms. Take some batter in your right hand from the bowl. Give it a round shape by moving it around.
With your thumb make a hole in the center. You can also use banana leaves or zip lock bags to give the medu vada its doughnut shape.
Frying Medu Vada
In a kadai (wok) or pan heat oil for deep frying. Keep the heat to medium. 
Once the oil becomes hot, slid the vada gently and carefully into the hot oil.
Shape the batter this way and gently slid them in the oil. Don't overcrowd the kadai or pan with the vada.
Once the vada is slightly golden then gently turn over with a slotted spoon and continue to fry.
Fry them till crisp and golden. The oil should be not very hot, but medium hot. You want the vadas to be cooked from inside. Very hot oil will quickly brown the vadas from outside but they will remain uncooked from inside. Less hot oil will make the medu vada to absorb too much oil. Even if the batter is thin then also the medu vadas will absorb too much oil.
Fry all the medu vada this way till they become evenly browned and crisp.
Drain them on kitchen tissue to remove excess oil.
Serve the medhu vadai, hot or warm with sambar and coconut chutney. It can also be served with other dips like mint chutney, coriander chutney, tomato sauce or onion chutney, tomato chutney etc.
One of the best combination is sambar vada where these medu vadai are dunked in piping hot sambar and served with a side of coconut chutney. This vada sambar meal is finished with steaming hot filter coffee."

Break the dough towards the end and press it to the last concentric circle of the spiral.
Frying
Heat oil for deep frying in a pan. Take a small piece of the dough and check the temperature of the oil.
If the dough comes up gradually, then the oil is ready. If the dough sits at the bottom, the oil is still cold. If the piece of dough comes up briskly and quickly, the oil is too hot.
TIP – Have a bite into the fried piece of dough and if it tastes hard, add ½ or 1 tablespoon of hot oil or butter to the dough and knead again.
Lift the chakli gently and slid into the hot oil.
Fry 3 to 4 chakli at a time. Do not over crowd the kadai or pan while frying.
TIP – Check the first batch of chakli. If it looks like the chakli has absorbed oil or breaks in oil, then add some rice flour, about 1 to 2 tablespoons and knead again. This happens if too much fat has gone in the dough.
Fry them until crisp and golden.
Drain them on paper towels to remove extra oil.
Make chakli with the remaining dough on the parchment paper. Cover them with a dry kitchen napkin, so that they don't dry out.

Next, depending on the size of the oven, place the beaten rice on the baking sheet, drizzle a little bit of oil based on the quantity and then a little bit of salt.

Now stir to combine the oil and salt into the beaten rice. The oil we add is just to make sure the salt gets coated onto the beaten rice to give a nice taste.

Place the beaten rice into the oven and bake for 5 to 7 minutes until very very lightly browned. Monitor closely as each oven works differently.

Proceed the same way with the remaining beaten rice and then keep them all together in a large bowl or a baking tray.

Our next step is to roast each on the individual ingredients.

In a small pan, dry roast the sesame seeds until it crackles. Once it does, then add it to the baked beaten rice.

Add in the roasted peanuts and almonds into the beaten rice as well.

(Dont stir as yet, the more you keep stirring, the beaten rice will tend to crumble.)

Next heat half a teaspoon of oil in the same small pan; add in the raisins and roast until it bloats up. Remove from the heat and pour it over the beaten rice. If you let it roast for longer than the bloating stage, then the raisins will become stiff.

Next add in half a teaspoon of oil into the above pan and roast the green chillies, until lightly crisp and browned. Pour this over the beaten rice again.

Finally heat a teaspoon of oil in the above pan; once the oil is heated, turn off the heat - add to this oil - the turmeric powder, red chilli powder and asafoetida powder. Stir to mix well.

Pour this over the beaten rice.

Finally, add the powdered sugar and the curry leaf powder over the beaten rice.

In a pan, add the blended batter and cook it on a medium flame on a stovetop. Keep stirring continuously, the batter should be thick enough. It will take approximately 5-7 minutes to cook. The timing may vary depending on the intensity of the flame.
Note - Do not stop stirring as gram flour (Besan) will start forming lumps.
To check whether the batter is thick enough, do a test after 4-5 minutes. Spread few teaspoons of the batter to the plate/mat. Let it cool and then begin to roll, if it doesn't get rolled up the batter needs to be cooked more. And if it rolls up easily, batter is ready.

Mash the banana in a bowl. Add the methi leaves to it.
Add all the ingredients including the 2 tsp oil.
Add very little water, about 1 or 2 tbsp and make a thick batter, like a thick cake batter.
We are making a thick batter first so that later, the batter will become thin as the methi leaves will start to leave water. This also depends on how much water content the methi leaves have.
Keep this batter covered aside for 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes check the batter.
The batter should be of smooth, flowing consistency.
If the batter is still thick then you can add a few tbsps of water.
Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or deep fryer.
When the oil is medium hot. Drop the batter from 1 tbsp measuring spoon into the oil.
Take care not to touch the spoon with the hot oil. You can also use a regular spoon.
As soon as you drop the spoonful of batter in the oil, they will start puffing up and expand a bit and becoming brown.
Since we have added bananas the browning happens faster. So fry on a medium hot oil.
Fry the methi pakoras till golden and crisp all over.
Drain the methi pakoras on paper towels to remove excess oil.
Serve methi na gota hot with any green chutney or tomato sauce.

Black rice,"Forbidden black rice, chicken, olive oil, slivered almonds, garlic powder",non vegetarian,-1,-1,-1,main course,Manipur,North East,"Although you can use either japonica or traditional black rice (they're both delicious), I really like the traditional (also sometimes called pearl black rice) as it makes a prettier presentation. All the little grains stay intact and remain a nice deep color.
You can use plain water for this recipe or add one chicken or one vegetable bouillon cube. Don't be tempted to use all broth as it gets very concentrated by the end of the cooking time and even low sodium broth will make the rice too salty.
Cooked black rice keeps very well so it's great to make ahead. I like to make a double batch and use it all week long for sides and salads. Just drizzle it with a tiny bit of olive oil after it cools then stir with a fork to coat the individual grains before storing it in the refrigerator.
Don't skip the rinsing and swishing step in the recipe. It helps to eliminate the excess starch which can make the rice gummy.
12 cups of water may sound like a lot but most of it will be evaporated during the cooking period.
Next time you're thinking of serving rice as a side, think about how pretty it might be with black rice. For example, this Coconut Curry Chicken or this Asian Maple Glazed Salmon would be gorgeous served with black rice!"

Chingri Bhape,"Coconut, prawns, curd, mustard seed, green chili",non vegetarian,15,30,-1,main course,West Bengal,East,"Soak the mustard seeds in hot water for at least 2 hours. Alternatively, you can also soak them in regular water, overnight.
Shell and devein the prawns. Keep the heads intact; they have all the flavour. The tails add a visual flair, so we keep them as well.
Strain the mustard seeds and add to a grinder jar, along with the salt and 3 green chillies.
Blitz into a fine paste with the help of 50 g water. Scrape down the sides as often as you need, and grind again. Repeat this process till you have a smooth paste.

IF YOU ARE NOT USING A MICROWAVE OVEN, place the prawns-and-mustard mixture in a covered steel container (such as a water-tight tiffin box). Bring an inch of water to boil in your pressure cooker or boiling pot. Now, carefully lower the tiffin box in the water. Be sure to check that the water level does not does not reach the lid of your tiffin box. If it does, throw away some of the water till it clears the lid. Cover up the pot/pressure cooker and allow the prawns to steam (for 10–12 minutes in the boiling pot OR for one whistle in a pressure cooker).

Kabiraji,"Fish fillet, besan, lemon, mint, ginger",non vegetarian,-1,-1,spicy,main course,West Bengal,East,"The process of marinating the fish fillet for kabiraji is similar to that of fish fry. So, follow the steps outlined in our fish fry recipe up to the breading stage.
While breading, give the fish cutlet will only a single layer of breadcrumb coating. We don't want a thick crust for kabiraji.
Once you've breaded the cutlet, fry it on medium-high heat (oil temp.: ~190°C). Remove from the oil, once brown.
Using a mortar-pestle, make a paste of green chillies and pepper corns with ¼ tsp salt.
Beat 200 g eggs with 4 g of the salt-pepper-chilli paste made above.
Rest the beaten eggs for 15 minutes. The eggs will darken in colour and turn watery.
Take maida and cornflour in a small bowl. Add 4–5 tablespoons of the beaten egg mixture to it. Once smooth and lump-free, add this mixture back to the remaining eggs. This is to avoid the formation of lumps caused by adding flour directly to the eggs. (We will refer to this as the 'egg batter' from now on.)
Now, beat two eggs separately in a different bowl and set aside. (We will refer to this as the 'beaten eggs' from now on.)
Heat the largest flat frying pan you possess on medium-high heat. A large pan will allow you to create a larger covering, and hence more layers.
Add vegetable oil at least 3 cm deep.
When the oil is moderately hot (~180°C), dip your fingers in the egg batter and swing your wrists over the pan (keeping your fingers straight) to form thin strands of fried egg. Do this repeatedly, until an airy, crunchy carpet forms. Don't rush! Let the web form slowly, in layers.
Sprinkle coriander and a pinch of jowan (carom seeds) over the web of fried egg.
Dip a fish cutlet in the beaten eggs. Remember this is not the same as the kabiraji batter.
Place the cutlet on one end of the egg covering. Turn and roll the cutlet, so that the egg covering envelopes it in several layers.
Remove from the oil and drain the excess fat on paper towels for a minute. Don't let it sit too long, or the covering will turn soggy; serve while it's still hot and crispy."

Mishti Chholar Dal,"Chana dal, fresh coconut, ginger, cinnamon, raisins",vegetarian,10,30,sweet,main course,West Bengal,East,"Rinse the chhola’r dal well and soak it in water for at least 2 hours. After this time, strain the dal and transfer it to a boiling pot or pressure cooker. Add 700 g water, 6 g salt, and the bay leaves. Boil the dal until it is tender, but the grains are still whole. The texture of this dish will depend a whole lot on how well the dal is boiled. We want each grain of lentil to be perfectly cooked, but not turned to mush. On medium heat, our chhola’r dal cooks to the desired doneness in 2 whistles. The time may vary for you.
Before you begin cooking, make a spice slurry by mixing together the ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder and 50 g water. Also, slice the coconut and slit the green chillies.
Heat mustard oil in a pan (on medium heat) and once it starts to smoke lightly and changes colour to a pale yellow, add the thinly sliced coconut. Fry until the coconut turns golden brown. This should take about a minute. Remove from the oil and set aside.
Temper the same oil with the dried red chillies, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds. Stir in the hing, allowing it to fry for about 10 seconds.
Add the spice slurry we made earlier to the pan. Fry on medium heat until the raw smell of the spices is gone. This should take about 6 minutes. Add the slit green chillies and raisins, and continue frying until you see oil leaving the sides of the spice mixture.
Now add the boiled dal along with the water to the pan. (If you feel there’s a lot of excess water with the dal, reserve some in a bowl.)
Add the remaining salt (12 g) and allow the dal to bubble until it thickens (about 6 to 8 minutes). Depending on how soft or hard your dal is, you may have to adjust the flame and water accordingly. For example, if your dal is still slightly hard, boil on low heat, adding water to maintain consistency, until it is cooked. If it is on the softer, mushier side (first of all, you need to make note of where you went wrong and try correcting the boiling time on your next attempt!), turn up the flame to thicken the dal quickly.
Pick out a softened green chilli from the dal, mash it with the back of a spoon and add it back to the dal. Add the sugar and bubble for about a minute before stirring in the ghee, Bengali garam masala, and fried coconut. Allow the dal to rest, covered, for 2 minutes before serving."

Usually a mud pot is used. But you can use other utensils as well.
While serving, add curd, crushed green chillies and lemon slices to it. Add the crushed cumin and fennel seed to it. (You can add all these just before an hour of serving also.)
There is a special way to serve this dish. Take 4 bowls and put the rice equally in each bowl. Equally pour in the added water in each bowl. Add salt per taste. The best way to have it is using your finger not spoon. So in one bite you drain a handful of rice from the bowl and use your fingers to eat it. Enjoy Pakhala!"
