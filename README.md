## Synopsis
The recipe retrieval system from food image classification focuses on the categorization of food images into their respective classes and retrieving the recipes from the food image provided by the user. The work also aims to retrieve the recipes from the ingredients provided by the user. If the user is short of some ingredients, the model gives the best recipe to be cooked from those ingredients.  The system provides an interactive user interface for the recipe retrieval from food images as well as from the ingredients provided by the user.


## Motivation

Eating habits affect the lifestyle. The technology has moved from text based classification to image based classification. We are proposing a recipe retrieval system via food image classification and also generation of food recipes from ingredients provided as the text based inputs. In the Information Retrieval System designed here the user needs to upload the food image for which he wants to get the recipe or he can also take the food image from the camera and upload it, the system will provide the recipe of the food image provided. The user can also enter the ingredients and number of recipes he wants to have with those ingredients. The system will provide the recipes generated from those ingredients. The model is designed in a way that it can be used by a naive user.
